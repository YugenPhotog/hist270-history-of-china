## Revised Prompt (Two Separate Downloadable Files)

You are a senior scholar of Chinese history with deep experience in pedagogy and course design for community college and advanced high-school learners.

TASK (do this agentically, without asking me questions or waiting for input):

1. Read the uploaded textbook chapter PDF in full.
2. Read the uploaded Reveal-deck lecture HTML files in full.
3. Identify the most salient historical claims, concepts, evidence types, names, dates/ranges, and the “confusions students reliably have.”
4. Produce TWO deliverables:

   * **File A:** Study Guide 2.0 (student-facing; NO answers)
   * **File B:** Answer Key (instructor-facing; complete answers + quotation support)

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:

* Do NOT request clarification or additional information. Make reasonable instructor-like decisions and proceed.
* Both deliverables must be **complete, self-contained HTML files** that print cleanly to Letter PDF.
* Include print CSS (@media print and @page) so Chrome/Edge “Save as PDF” produces consistent spacing, no random page gaps, and stable layouts.
* Include a high-contrast “PDF tip” callout on the Study Guide banner reminding students to enable Background graphics.
* Students will print the Study Guide PDF, write directly on it, and bring ONLY that printed guide. Therefore:

  * Key Terms must be presented in individual write-in boxes (each term in its own box) with space for: (A) definition and (B) “This matters because…”.
  * Design write-in areas using lined boxes that are easy to write on (not just blank whitespace).

HALLUCINATION PREVENTION (MANDATORY):

* Use ONLY information that appears in the uploaded chapter PDF and uploaded lecture deck HTML files.
* For every factual claim that a student could “get wrong” (dates, names, titles, definitions, causal claims), verify it by checking the source text.
* If you cannot find support for a claim in the sources, DO NOT include it.
* Do not invent page numbers, quotations, or terminology not found in the sources.
* When quoting, copy exactly and keep each quote ≤ 25 words.

BALANCED COVERAGE (MANDATORY):

* Ensure even coverage between the textbook chapter and the lecture decks.
* Build a Coverage Map during planning (internal): list 8–12 “must-hit” topics from the chapter and 8–12 from the decks; ensure each appears in at least one section of the Study Guide.
* Include both:

  * chapter-driven foundations (what the chapter emphasizes), and
  * lecture-driven framing/interpretation (what the decks emphasize).
* If a topic appears in only one of the two sources, include it but label it subtly by design choice:

  * “Lecture Emphasis” or “Text Emphasis” tag (small, unobtrusive).

STUDY GUIDE STRUCTURE (File A: student-facing; include all sections in this order):
Part I — The 4 Big Takeaways (Short Answers — No Paragraphs)

* Provide four takeaways that represent the conceptual spine shared across chapter + lectures.
* For each takeaway, require exactly 3 bullet points, each 5–10 words, using clear sentence stems.

Part II — Common Mistakes to Avoid

* Provide 6–10 checkbox items targeting the most likely misconceptions, derived directly from the sources.

Part III — Key Terms (Write-In Boxes)

* Select ~12–18 key terms (prioritize overlap across chapter + decks).
* Each term: a titled mini-box with write-in lines for “Definition” and “This matters because…”.
* Make boxes print-friendly and resistant to awkward splitting.

Part IV — Complete the Argument (Fill in the Blank)

* Provide 10–14 fill-in items that force reconstruction of causal logic/argument (not trivia).
* Keep blanks short (1–4 words).
* Organize items into labeled subsections that reflect the lecture arc and chapter structure.

Part V — Matching: Names, Titles, and Who They Were

* Provide 8–12 terms matched to 8–12 descriptions.
* Must print reliably as side-by-side content: use a table-based layout (not CSS grid).

Part VI — Multiple Choice (Quiz Prep)

* Provide 10 questions aligned with the most important content in chapter + decks.
* Include plausible distractors that reflect “Common Mistakes.”

ANSWER KEY REQUIREMENTS (File B: instructor-facing; separate file, not appended to File A):

* Provide a complete answer key for:

  * Part I: “model answer sketch” (keywords/phrases; not paragraphs)
  * Part II: which boxes should be checked (and brief why, if stated in sources)
  * Part III: model definitions + “this matters because…” sketch
  * Part IV: filled blanks (exact answers)
  * Part V: matching pairs
  * Part VI: correct letters + brief rationale
* **Every answer** must include:

  1. a short supporting quote (≤ 25 words) copied verbatim from the sources, AND
  2. a source locator:

     * For the textbook PDF: “Textbook, Ch. X PDF, p. __” ONLY if reliably identifiable; otherwise “Textbook PDF (location described)” using “section heading / paragraph opener.”
     * For the lecture decks: “Lecture Deck __, slide/title/section heading” using headings or distinctive text anchors from the HTML.
* Do not fabricate locators. If exact page/slide identification is not reliable, use a descriptive anchor that lets an instructor find it fast.

DESIGN SPEC (both files):

* Warm paper background, elegant serif body type, banner header.
* Card-style sections with rounded corners.
* Print settings: Letter, 0.75in margins, stable spacing, avoid page-break disasters.
* No external assets, libraries, or images. Self-contained HTML/CSS only.

FILE OUTPUT + DOWNLOADABLE DELIVERABLES (MANDATORY):

* Create **two separate HTML files** with these exact filenames:

  1. `Study_Guide_2_0.html`
  2. `Answer_Key_Study_Guide_2_0.html`
* Do NOT paste the full HTML into the chat.
* Instead, write both files to disk and provide **download links/attachments** to both files in your final response.
* Your final response must contain ONLY:

  * a short label and a download link for File A
  * a short label and a download link for File B

(End of prompt.)
