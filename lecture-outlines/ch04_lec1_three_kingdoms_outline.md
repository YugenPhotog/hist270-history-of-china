# HIST 270: History of China
## Chapter 4, Lecture 1: When the Center Cannot Hold — The Three Kingdoms and the Collapse of Unity (184–316 CE)

**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Political fragmentation, military transformation, and elite withdrawal  
**Header Color:** Vermillion (Political chapter)

---

## Big Question
What happens when a 400-year empire collapses? Why couldn't anyone put it back together?

---

## Series Overview: The Period of Division

This three-lecture series covers one of Chinese history's most transformative eras—nearly four centuries (200–580 CE) when political unity shattered, non-Chinese peoples ruled the north, and Buddhism transformed Chinese civilization. Students often overlook this period because it lacks a single dynasty name, but these centuries fundamentally reshaped what it meant to be "Chinese."

**Lecture Arc:**
1. **Lecture 1 (This lecture):** Political collapse, the Three Kingdoms, and the Western Jin failure
2. **Lecture 2:** Non-Chinese rule in the north and the question of Chinese identity
3. **Lecture 3:** Buddhism's conquest and religious transformation

**How This Complements the Textbook:**
The textbook covers extensive political detail across multiple dynasties. These lectures instead emphasize:
- The *human experience* of collapse (elite withdrawal, refugee crisis)
- The *cultural problem* of identity when "barbarians" rule China
- The *intellectual revolution* of Buddhism arriving when Confucianism seemed inadequate

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain why the Han Dynasty collapsed and why reunification failed for centuries
2. Describe how warfare and government changed during the Three Kingdoms period
3. Analyze the intellectual and cultural responses to political chaos
4. Connect the Period of Division to patterns in other civilizations' "dark ages"

## Lecture Roadmap

### 1. Hook: "Romance vs. Reality" (5 minutes)

**Open with surprise:**
"How many of you have played *Dynasty Warriors*? Or watched *Red Cliff*? The Three Kingdoms period is the most famous era in all of Chinese popular culture—there are more video games, TV shows, novels, and movies about this period than any other. But here's what popular culture gets wrong..."

**Show contrast:**
- Popular image: heroic warriors, brilliant strategists, noble loyalty
- Historical reality: famine, plague, population collapse (census drops from 60 million to 16 million), endless suffering

**Setup the problem:**
"Today we ask: Why couldn't anyone rebuild the Han? And what happens to a civilization when the educated elite just... give up on government?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- Use pop culture reference to hook students (especially gamers)
- Don't dismiss *Romance of the Three Kingdoms*—it's still valuable for understanding Chinese cultural memory
- The population collapse (from 60 million to 16 million recorded) is shocking—but note census issues
- Frame lecture as understanding *why* this era was actually dark, not glorious

### 2. The Han Collapse: A Perfect Storm (10 minutes)

**Key narrative: How 400 years of stability unraveled in a generation**

**A. The Yellow Turban Rebellion (184 CE)**
- Not just a peasant revolt—a *religious* uprising
- The Way of Great Peace (Taiping Dao): Daoist-inspired millenarian movement
- "The Blue Heaven is dead; the Yellow Heaven shall rise"
- Hundreds of thousands of followers attacked simultaneously across the empire

**B. The Fatal Response**
- Han court gave generals and local officials permission to raise private armies
- This "temporary" measure created permanent warlordism
- Once military power was decentralized, it never came back

**C. The Cascade of Disasters**
- 189 CE: Warlord sacks capital, kills 2,000+ eunuchs, takes emperor prisoner
- 190 CE: Coalition against the warlord fails; civil war begins
- Libraries and archives burned at Luoyang—massive loss of knowledge
- 205 CE: Cao Cao emerges as dominant figure in the north

**Discussion prompt (brief):**
"We saw the Qin collapse after 15 years, but the Han lasted 400. What made the Han's collapse so much harder to recover from?"
- Expected responses: size of empire, depth of civil war, loss of institutions
- Guide toward: once military power decentralizes, it's very hard to re-concentrate

**Teaching Notes:**
- Emphasize religious dimension of Yellow Turbans—this is NOT just economic grievance
- The eunuch massacre is violent but important—it shows complete institutional breakdown
- Cao Cao (tsow tsow) is a crucial figure—brilliant but ruthless; students may know him as a villain from the novel

### 3. ⏸ Pause & Process #1: Collapse Comparison (5 minutes)

**Activity: Think-Pair-Share**

**Prompt displayed on slide:**
"The Western Roman Empire collapsed around the same time (476 CE). Based on what you know about Rome's fall, how does the Han collapse compare? What similarities? What differences?"

**Process:**
- 2 minutes: Individual thinking/notes
- 2 minutes: Partner discussion
- 1 minute: Quick whole-class share (2-3 responses)

**Expected comparisons:**
- Similarities: Border peoples, military decentralization, economic stress, plague
- Differences: China reunified (eventually); Europe didn't for over 1,000 years
- Geography matters: China's heartland more geographically coherent

**Why this works pedagogically:**
Connects new material to students' likely prior knowledge (Roman history); raises the question we'll answer over three lectures—why DID China reunify when Europe didn't?

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't spend too long on this—it's a comprehension check and attention reset
- If students don't know much about Rome, that's fine—the comparison still frames the question
- Plant the seed that we'll return to "why China reunified" in Lecture 3

### 4. The Three Kingdoms: Not What You Think (12 minutes)

**Frame: Popular culture vs. historical reality**

**A. The Three States (220–265 CE)**
Display simple map showing:
- **Wei** (north): Cao Cao's son forces Han emperor to abdicate; capital at Luoyang
- **Wu** (southeast): Sun Quan controls Yangzi valley; naval power
- **Shu** (southwest): Liu Bei claims Han legitimacy from Sichuan

"Notice something? None of these 'kingdoms' could conquer the others for 45 years. Why?"

**B. Military Transformation**
This is the era when Chinese warfare fundamentally changed:

1. **Cavalry revolution**
   - The stirrup (invented ~300 CE) made cavalry more effective
   - Heavy armored cavalry could fight in shock combat
   - "By the fourth century, sources mention capturing thousands of armored horses in single battles"

2. **Military households**
   - Wei created permanent soldier families (hereditary military status)
   - Soldiers' families farmed assigned land, paid rent to state
   - Created a separate military caste—different from Han conscription system

3. **Incorporation of non-Chinese troops**
   - All three kingdoms recruited Xiongnu and other steppe peoples
   - These weren't just mercenaries—they settled in border regions
   - "Setting the table" for non-Chinese rule in the next century

**C. The Romance vs. Reality**
Brief acknowledgment of what makes this period so famous:
- Zhuge Liang: the "Sleeping Dragon," legendary strategist
- Liu Bei: the noble pretender claiming Han blood
- Guan Yu: the god of war (literally worshipped later)

"The *Romance of the Three Kingdoms* (14th century novel) made these figures into Chinese mythology. But the historical reality? Endless war, depleted population, devastated agriculture."

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't get lost in Three Kingdoms details—focus on WHY unity was impossible
- Military household system is key: it creates permanent soldier class that will interact with non-Chinese steppe traditions
- Students interested in the novel should be directed to it—it's genuinely great literature

### 5. The Western Jin: Reunification's False Dawn (8 minutes)

**Key narrative: Why victory doesn't mean stability**

**A. The Sima Family's Rise**
- Sima Yan (general) forces Wei emperor to abdicate (265 CE)
- Conquers Wu in 280 CE—China unified for first time in 60 years
- "But the Jin Dynasty would last only 36 years before catastrophe"

**B. The Jin Founder's Fatal Mistake**
- Sima Yan worried that no general could overthrow him (the way he had overthrown Wei)
- Solution: Give his own relatives armies and land
- Created eight powerful princes controlling regional military forces
- "He was so worried about what his generals might do that he armed his relatives instead. The result was worse."

**C. The War of the Eight Princes (291–306 CE)**
- After Sima Yan died, his relatives fought for control
- Each prince controlled regional army, marched on the capital
- Luoyang repeatedly sacked; emperors deposed one after another
- Princes began recruiting Xiongnu and Xianbei cavalry to fight each other
- "They invited the wolves in to guard the sheep"

**D. The Catastrophe of 311 CE**
- Xiongnu leader Liu Yuan declared himself emperor (claiming Han descent!)
- His army captured Luoyang, took the Jin emperor prisoner
- "The same capital that had ruled China for centuries was sacked by people the Chinese had considered 'barbarians'"
- 316 CE: Last Western Jin emperor surrendered; dynasty ended

**Primary Source Quote:**
"When an army of Xianbei warriors took Chang'an in 306, they pillaged the city, reportedly slaughtering twenty thousand residents."

**Teaching Notes:**
- The War of Eight Princes is crucial—it's why non-Chinese conquest happened
- Liu Yuan claiming Han ancestry is fascinating: legitimacy matters even to "conquerors"
- Note the violence explicitly—students need to understand the human cost

### 6. ⏸ Pause & Process #2: Elite Response to Chaos (5 minutes)

**Activity: Document Analysis**

**Display primary source on slide:**
> When someone rebuked Ruan Ji for talking to his sister-in-law, he replied, "Surely you do not mean to suggest that the rules of propriety apply to me?"

**Context provided:** Ruan Ji was one of the "Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove"—elite intellectuals who responded to political chaos by rejecting Confucian respectability.

**Discussion Questions:**
1. What is Ruan Ji's attitude toward Confucian social rules?
2. Why might educated elites have rejected propriety during this period?
3. Is this response to chaos productive or self-destructive?

**Teaching Notes:**
- The Seven Sages represent elite *withdrawal* from government
- This is the opposite of Han-era Confucian activism
- Some students will sympathize; others will criticize—both responses are valid
- Connect to next segment on intellectual/cultural responses

### 7. When the Educated Give Up: Cultural Responses to Chaos (8 minutes)

**Frame: What happens when serving government becomes too dangerous?**

**A. The Nine Rank System's Corruption**
- Originally meant to identify talented men for office
- Quickly became a tool for elite families to monopolize positions
- "Men whose families were ranked high did not have to start at the bottom of the bureaucracy"
- Result: Government service became about *birth*, not merit
- Brain drain: Why risk your life in politics when your family rank guarantees status?

**B. The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove**
- Famous group of intellectuals who gathered for wine, poetry, and music
- Deliberately provocative behavior: public nudity, refusing mourning rituals
- "Study of the Mysterious" (xuanxue)—philosophical discussions of Laozi and Zhuangzi
- Focus on spontaneity, naturalness, rejection of artificial Confucian forms

**C. Poetry and Calligraphy as Retreat**
- Cao Cao and his sons (Cao Pei, Cao Zhi) were gifted poets despite being warlords
- Poetry became vehicle for expressing emotions politics made dangerous to voice directly
- Wang Xizhi (fourth century): greatest calligrapher in Chinese history
  - His writing admired for "grace, forcefulness, and subtle modulations"
  - Art as alternative arena for achievement

**Key insight:**
"When politics becomes deadly, talented people find other outlets. The Period of Division produced some of China's greatest poetry and calligraphy precisely because politics had become so dangerous."

**Discussion prompt (brief):**
"Is this withdrawal selfish, or is it a rational response to impossible circumstances?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't moralize—help students see withdrawal as historically contingent
- The arts flourished in chaos: this is a pattern worth noting
- Wang Xizhi will appear on countless Chinese paintings and poems—he's like Shakespeare for calligraphy

### 8. Closing: The Refugee Generation (2 minutes)

**Synthesis:**

"By 316, the north was lost. The Jin court fled south to Nanjing. With them went tens of thousands of elite families—refugees from a world that had collapsed."

**Statistics to emphasize:**
- Some scholars estimate 60% of northern elite families fled south between 311–325
- They brought their books, their genealogies, and their sense of superiority
- "These refugees would shape southern culture for centuries"

**Preview for Lecture 2:**
"But what about those who stayed in the north? And what about the non-Chinese peoples who now ruled China's heartland? Next time, we explore the most important question the Period of Division raised: What does it mean to be Chinese when 'barbarians' rule the Chinese homeland?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- End on the human note: refugees carrying their civilization south
- Tease the identity question that drives Lecture 2
- Don't over-explain—let students sit with the weight of collapse
