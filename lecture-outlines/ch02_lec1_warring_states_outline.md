# HIST 270: History of China
## Chapter 2, Lecture 1: Political Fragmentation & the Warring States System

**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** From Zhou collapse to total warfare  
**Header Color:** Vermillion (Political content)

---

## Big Question
How do you create order when everything is falling apart?

---

## Lecture Structure

### 1. Hook (4 minutes)
"771 BCE - Zhou king dead. What happens when the referee dies?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- Callback to end of Chapter 1
- Set up crisis: Zhou authority collapsed, states now independent
- Frame today's question: political fragmentation and competition

---

### 2. The Multistate System Emerges (10 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- Spring and Autumn period (770-479 BCE) transforms into Warring States period (479-256 BCE)
- Hegemon system breaks down
  - Initially: powerful states act as "hegemons" maintaining order
  - Gradually: hegemons compete, no one can enforce rules
  - Result: free-for-all warfare
- Seven major states remain by 3rd century BCE (Qin, Chu, Zhao, Wei, Han, Yan, Qi)
- Map showing territorial consolidation

**Teaching Notes:**
- Emphasize PROCESS of fragmentation, not just dates
- Show map: ~170 states at start, only 7 major ones by 300 BCE
- Analogy: imagine if US states started declaring war on each other after federal government collapsed
- Key insight: states grew larger even as their NUMBER decreased (consolidation through conquest)

### 3. Pause & Process #1 (3 minutes)

**Activity: Quick Write**
"Why would smaller states disappear? Write down two reasons."

**Expected Responses:**
- Conquered by larger neighbors
- Absorbed through alliances that failed
- Couldn't compete militarily
- Economically outmatched

**Teaching Notes:**
- Call on 2-3 students to share
- Synthesize: "Right - the logic is brutal. Grow or die. This isn't gradual decline, it's Darwinian competition."
- Transition: "So how did warfare itself change?"

---

### 4. The Warfare Revolution (15 minutes)

**Key Points:**

**From Chariots to Infantry (5 minutes):**
- Spring and Autumn: aristocratic chariot warfare
  - Chariots expensive, elite warriors
  - Battles brief, ceremonial elements
  - Casualties relatively low
- Warring States: mass infantry armies
  - Crossbow invention (southern Chu state) changes everything
  - Foot soldiers can kill aristocratic warriors
  - Armies grow from thousands to hundreds of thousands

**Iron Weapons and Armor (3 minutes):**
- Iron weapons widespread by 5th century BCE
- Bronze still used but iron becomes standard
- Mass production possible
- Elite troops get iron armor, helmets

**New Tactics and Scale (7 minutes):**
- Conscription replaces aristocratic levies
  - Peasants drafted for military service
  - Universal male military obligation
- Siege warfare develops
  - Walled cities become targets
  - Tunneling, ladders, siege towers
  - Prolonged campaigns (months, even years)
- Campaigns on multiple fronts simultaneously
- Qin defeat of Zhao (260 BCE): hundreds of thousands engaged, lasted 3 years

**Military Logic:**
- Destroy rivals or be destroyed
- No longer fighting for honor - fighting for survival
- Winner-take-all mentality

**Teaching Notes:**
- This is NOT just military history - social transformation
- Aristocracy loses military monopoly
- Common people drafted = need to train/feed/supply them = administrative revolution
- Warfare becomes TOTAL: entire society mobilized
- Compare to WWI "total war" - similar mobilization of whole societies

**Image Placeholders:**
- Bronze Age chariot reconstruction
- Warring States crossbow mechanism
- Terra cotta warriors showing armor and weapons (preview of Qin)
- Search terms: "Chinese crossbow ancient mechanism", "Warring States infantry armor", "terracotta warriors weapons detail"

### 5. Rise of the Shi Class (10 minutes)

**Key Points:**

**Old Aristocracy Declining:**
- Hereditary ranks mean less
- Military defeats destroy old noble families
- Rulers need TALENT, not just pedigree

**The Shi Emerge:**
- Shi originally meant lower-ranking aristocrats or knights
- By Warring States: means educated men serving as advisors
- Could come from modest backgrounds
- Expertise in:
  - Military strategy
  - Administration
  - Diplomacy
  - Philosophy and persuasion

**Merit Over Birth:**
- Rulers hire talented shi as ministers
- Competition for good advisors
- Shi travel between states selling their ideas
- "Itinerant philosophers" = shi seeking patronage

**Why This Matters:**
- **This creates the context for philosophical debates**
- Philosophers are shi trying to convince rulers
- Different philosophies = different strategies for surviving chaos
- Next lecture: we'll meet these philosophers

**Teaching Notes:**
- Draw parallel to Renaissance Italy: city-states competing, hiring best talent
- Or: free agent market in sports - states competing for talent
- Key insight: CRISIS creates OPPORTUNITY for talented individuals
- Social mobility increases dramatically
- This is background for understanding why we get philosophical explosion

### 6. Pause & Process #2 (3 minutes)

**Activity: Partner Discussion**
"If you were a Warring States ruler, what kind of advisor would you want? Someone who focuses on moral virtue? Military strategy? Economic development? Strict laws? Discuss with partner for 90 seconds."

**Debrief (90 seconds):**
- "So we have different opinions - some want virtue, some want strength, some want prosperity."
- "THAT'S the debate in ancient China too! Different philosophers will offer different solutions."
- "There's no single 'right' answer - depends on your values and your situation."

**Teaching Notes:**
- This primes students for philosophical debates next lecture
- Helps them see philosophers as practical advisors, not abstract thinkers
- Validates multiple perspectives

---

### 7. Economic and Social Changes (5 minutes)

**Key Points:**

**Economic Growth:**
- Iron agriculture leads to increased production
- More food supports larger populations
- Surplus allows for craft specialization

**Cities Growing:**
- Walled cities become centers of power
- Artisans, merchants, officials concentrate in cities
- Urban culture develops

**Trade Expanding:**
- Money (coins) circulating widely
- Copper coins standardized within states
- Trade networks across state boundaries
- Markets for goods, military supplies

**Social Mobility:**
- Old certainties collapsing
- Merchants can become wealthy
- Talented individuals rise through service
- Hereditary status matters less
- Family background matters less

**Result: Dynamic, Chaotic, Opportunistic Society**

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't get bogged down in economic details
- Main point: society is TRANSFORMING, not just politically but economically and socially
- Old Zhou order completely gone
- Everything up for grabs
- This explains urgency of philosophical questions

---

### 8. Wrap-up (3 minutes)

**Synthesis:**
"So where are we? Zhou Dynasty collapsed in 771 BCE. For the next 500 years, China is divided into competing states locked in total warfare. Aristocracy declines, talented commoners rise. Everything is uncertain. Everything is being rethought."

**Big Question Answered:**
"How do you create order when everything falls apart? That's what the philosophers will try to answer. Different solutions, different values, different visions of human nature and society."

**Preview Next Lecture:**
"Next time: The Hundred Schools of Thought. We'll focus on Confucius and his critics - specifically Mozi, Mencius, and Xunzi. These thinkers all ask: Can virtue govern? Is human nature good or bad? Can ritual create order?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't oversell next lecture - brief preview only
- End with the philosophical question, not administrative details
- Reinforce that philosophers are responding to THIS crisis
