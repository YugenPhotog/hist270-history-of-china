# LECTURE 3: Scholar-Officials, Reform Debates, and the Jin Conquest

**50 minutes | Focus: How did debates over government reform split the Song elite, and what were the consequences when the Jurchen established the Jin Dynasty?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
Wang Anshi wanted to make land taxes more equitable and create a local militia. His opponents said he was leading the dynasty to ruin and compared him to history's worst villains. Why did Song reform proposals generate such bitter conflict?

### 2. **The Song Scholar-Official Class** (10 minutes):
- **Examination system recruited 4-5 times more jinshi per year than Tang** (135 vs. 89)
- Three provincial-level exams: shengyuan (county), juren (province), jinshi (capital)
- Added screening test at province level, three sessions over a week
- Essays on Four Books passages, policy issues, Classic of Filial Piety
- Dynasty histories for policy preparation, judicial rulings for practical training
- Classical education became widespread, printing made books cheaper
- **Result**: Larger, better educated, less aristocratic scholar-official class
- Even those who failed gained prestige, could serve locally
- Officials' careers involved study, travel to capital for exams, county/prefectural posts
- Might spend 10-20 years in provinces before capital appointment

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: Was the examination system meritocratic? Consider: Who could afford years of education? Did it create social mobility?

### 4. **The Reform Debates** (13 minutes):
- 1040s: **Fan Zhongyan** initiated reform, called for higher pay for local officials, reforms
- Created tension between "idealistic officials" (criticizing system) and "mediocre officials" (defending status quo)
- Examination system made officials think alike but also created intense competition
- **Wang Anshi's reforms (1068-1085)**:
  - Low-cost loans to replace labor service tax
  - Land tax resurvey for equitable assessment
  - Local militia to reduce standing army costs
  - Poetry dropped from examinations (focus on policy and classics)
  - State monopolies on tea, salt, wine for revenue
- **Conservative opposition** (Sima Guang, Su Shi):
  - Reforms too obstructionist, causing more problems
  - Officials not skilled enough to implement complex policies
  - Reforms enriched state at expense of people
- **Philosophical dimension**: Principle-motivated reformers vs. pragmatic conservatives
- Personal antagonisms intensified: reformers called opponents "misguided or nefarious inferior men"
- When Shenzong died (1085), grandmother reversed reforms, banished reformers
- **1093: Zhezong reversed reversal**, brought reformers back, exiled anti-reformers
- Cycles of revenge and retaliation continued
- Reform program came to abrupt halt when Jurchen invaded

### 5. **The Jurchen and Jin Establishment** (9 minutes):
- Jurchens lived in villages and small walled towns in Manchuria, economy based on fishing, hunting, animal husbandry, farming
- **Mid-11th century**: Wanyan clan gained dominant position among Jurchens
- Wanyan Aguda (1068-1123) began challenging Liao authority in 1115
- Established Jin (Golden) Dynasty
- Song saw opportunity, made secret alliance with Jin to defeat Liao and divide territory
- **Plan backfired**: Jin discovered Song not much of military threat
- Jin attacked Song next, besieged Kaifeng
- Enormous ransom paid to escape slaughter; thousands taken captive including Huizong, craftsmen, entertainers
- Jin went on to establish stable government in north China
- Song rallied under emperor Gaozong, established capital at Hangzhou (1127)
- **Southern Song period begins** (1127-1276)

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: The Jin adopted Chinese political institutions and ruled more Chinese people than Khitans. What does this tell us about the relationship between military conquest and cultural adaptation?

### 7. **Confucian Learning Revival** (5 minutes):
- Loss of north to Jurchens led elite to lose confidence in reform
- Scholars began proposing ways to build ideal society from bottom up
- Reforming families, local communities, establishing schools and academies
- Greatest synthesizer: **Zhu Xi (1130-1200)**
- Selected Four Books (Analects, Mencius, Great Learning, Doctrine of the Mean)
- Wrote commentaries emphasizing "investigation of things" (careful rational study)
- Universal principles exist in all minds, clearing obstructions allows knowledge to surface
- Moral action results from true understanding (not separate from it)
- Way of Sages can be recovered through education and self-cultivation
- Teaching career through private academies
- 1241: Two generations after death, Zhu Xi credited with "illuminating the Way"
- Government students required to study his commentaries

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Song scholar-official class expanded education and split over how to govern a complex society. The Jurchen conquest forced adaptation and prompted the Confucian revival that would shape China for centuries.

**Big Question**: Did the Song reform debates strengthen or weaken the dynasty? Were these intellectual conflicts a sign of vitality or division?
