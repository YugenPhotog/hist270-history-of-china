### TITLE SLIDE (Slide 1)
**[0:00–1:00] 1 minute**

**Content:**
- HIST 270: History of China
- Chapter 18, Lecture 1
- "Cracks in the Empire: The Opium War and the Anatomy of Decline"
- Date Range: 1800–1842

**Presenter Notes:**
- Welcome students; this begins our unit on nineteenth-century China
- Preview: Today we examine WHY China was vulnerable before asking HOW the West exploited that vulnerability
- Connection to Chapter 16: Students should recall the Qing at its height under Qianlong—today we see the reversal
- Big question to plant: Was decline inevitable, or the result of choices?

---

### HOOK: THE DESTRUCTION AT HUMEN (Slides 2-3)
**[1:00–7:00] 6 minutes**

#### Slide 2: Opening Image
**Content:**
- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: "Destruction of opium Humen 1839 Lin Zexu"
- Caption: "June 1839: Commissioner Lin Zexu destroys 2.6 million pounds of British opium"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Let image settle—ask students what they see
- This is one of the most dramatic acts of drug enforcement in history
- Lin Zexu mixed opium with lime and salt, dissolved it in trenches, flushed it into the sea over 23 days
- The question: What happens when you destroy a foreign power's most profitable trade good?

#### Slide 3: The Paradox of Lin Zexu
**Content:**
- Lin Zexu was:
  - Competent (successful governor in multiple provinces)
  - Morally upright (known for integrity)
  - Strategically thoughtful (studied British capabilities)
- Yet his righteous action triggered catastrophe
- **Key Question:** What does it mean when doing the right thing leads to disaster?

**Presenter Notes:**
- Lin represents the best of Confucian governance—and its limits
- He genuinely believed moral example and firm action would work
- Foreshadow: The British response will reveal a world operating by different rules
- This lecture asks: Was the problem Lin's tactics, or something deeper in the system he served?

### SECTION 1: THE EMPIRE AT 1800 (Slides 4-9)
**[7:00–20:00] 13 minutes**

#### Slide 4: Section Header
**Content:**
- "The Empire at 1800: Prosperity's Price"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: Before examining the foreign threat, we must understand what was happening INSIDE China
- Students often assume China was "backward"—in fact, Qing China in 1800 was wealthy, populous, and seemed stable
- The problems were structural, not obvious

#### Slide 5: Population Explosion
**Content:**
- Population growth 1700–1850:
  - 1700: approximately 150 million
  - 1800: approximately 300 million
  - 1850: approximately 400 million
- New World crops (corn, sweet potatoes, peanuts) enabled cultivation of marginal land
- **The problem:** Population doubled, but arable land did not

**Popup Term: Malthusian Pressure**
- Definition: When population grows faster than food supply, leading to falling living standards
- Named for Thomas Malthus (1766–1834)
- China experienced classic symptoms: shrinking farm sizes, falling wages, increased poverty

**Presenter Notes:**
- This growth was initially seen as a SIGN OF SUCCESS—proof of Qing peace and prosperity
- Traditional Chinese view: large population equals strong state
- Reality: farms subdivided generation after generation until families couldn't survive
- Average farm size in some regions fell below subsistence level
- Compare to modern development challenges—population growth can outpace infrastructure

#### Slide 6: Consequences of Overpopulation
**Content:**
- Shrinking farms led to rural poverty
- Surplus labor depressed wages
- Young men left villages seeking work:
  - Seasonal laborers
  - Canal boatmen
  - Charcoal burners
  - Sedan chair carriers
  - Many became bandits or beggars
- Hard times increased female infanticide
- Shortage of marriageable women further destabilized society

**Presenter Notes:**
- Paint vivid picture: millions of young men with no land, no marriage prospects, no hope
- These "floating populations" would become recruits for rebellions (preview Taiping)
- The textbook notes increased female infanticide—families couldn't afford daughters
- This created gender imbalance, more unmarried men, more instability
- Connection: similar dynamics in modern China's "bare branches" problem

#### Slide 7: Fiscal Crisis
**Content:**
- Imperial revenues stayed flat while population tripled
- Problems compounding:
  - Grand Canal deteriorating (1824: grain ships stuck in silt)
  - Tax grain increasingly shipped by sea (more expensive)
  - Military costs rising
  - Corruption endemic
- Emperor Daoguang (reigned 1821–1850) ordered frugality—not enough

**Popup Term: Grand Canal**
- 1,747 kilometers long, crossing five major rivers
- Built over centuries, completed in Sui Dynasty (7th century)
- Carried tax grain from south to Beijing
- By 1800s: silted, poorly maintained, increasingly unusable
- Symbolizes infrastructure decay across the empire

**Presenter Notes:**
- The Grand Canal example is concrete: 50,000+ hereditary boatmen depending on grain transport
- When the canal failed, these boatmen became unemployed—many joined the Nian Rebellion
- Daoguang was genuinely frugal (wore patched robes), but individual virtue couldn't fix systemic problems
- Compare to modern infrastructure debates: maintenance is less glamorous than new construction

#### Slide 8: Military Decay
**Content:**
- **Banner Armies:** Originally fearsome Manchu cavalry
  - By 1800: essentially a welfare system
  - Bannermen received stipends but rarely trained
  - Many addicted to opium
- **Green Standard Army:** Chinese provincial forces
  - Underfunded, poorly equipped
  - Effective against bandits, useless against modern armies
- No navy to speak of

**Popup Term: Eight Banners**
- Military-social system created by Nurhaci (1559–1626)
- Originally organized Manchu warriors into eight color-coded units
- Later expanded to include Mongol and Chinese units
- By 19th century: hereditary privilege system, not fighting force
- Bannermen concentrated in Beijing and garrison cities, living on government stipends

**Presenter Notes:**
- Key irony: the Qing CONQUEST elite had become the Qing's greatest burden
- Emperor couldn't simply abolish banners—this was the Manchu power base
- Connection to Chapter 16: recall how early Qing rulers worried about Manchu "softening"
- Their fears came true, but no one could fix it without undermining dynasty itself
- The banner system's dysfunction will be crucial when Taiping Rebellion erupts

#### Slide 9: The Manchu Dilemma
**Content:**
- Qing rulers faced impossible choice:
  - Reform meant threatening Manchu privileges
  - Preserving privileges meant blocking reform
- Banner families resisted any changes to their status
- Conservative officials warned against "barbarian" innovations
- **Question for later:** Could ANY Qing ruler have broken this deadlock?

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is the structural trap that will doom every reform effort
- Preview Cixi: she will navigate this dilemma for 50 years
- The Manchus were perhaps 2% of China's population but monopolized top positions
- Reforming the military meant either arming Han Chinese (dangerous) or cutting banner stipends (politically impossible)
- Compare to other declining empires: Ottomans, Romanovs faced similar problems

---

### ⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (Slide 10)
**[20:00–24:00] 4 minutes**

#### Slide 10: Pause & Process — Systems Under Stress
**Content:**
- **Think-Pair-Share (3 minutes):**
- "Think about a large organization you know—a company, a government, a school, even a family business."
- "What happens when it grows faster than its management systems can handle?"
- "What makes reform difficult even when everyone knows change is needed?"
- Share one insight with a neighbor

**Presenter Notes:**
- **Purpose:** Connect abstract dynastic problems to students' lived experience
- **What you're doing:**
  1. Give 90 seconds for individual reflection
  2. Have pairs discuss for 90 seconds
  3. Cold-call 2-3 pairs for quick insights
- **Expected responses:** 
  - Bureaucracy, turf wars, "we've always done it this way"
  - People whose jobs depend on current system resist change
  - Hard to fix problems while also running day-to-day operations
- **Transition:** "The Qing faced all of these problems—and then a new challenge arrived from overseas."

---

### SECTION 2: THE OPIUM CRISIS (Slides 11-17)
**[24:00–38:00] 14 minutes**

#### Slide 11: Section Header
**Content:**
- "The Opium Crisis: A Drug War China Couldn't Win"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: We've seen internal weaknesses; now examine the external shock
- The opium trade didn't cause China's problems—but it made everything worse
- And it revealed how much the world had changed while China looked inward

#### Slide 12: Britain's Trade Problem
**Content:**
- British loved Chinese goods: tea, silk, porcelain
- Chinese had little interest in British goods
- Result: silver flowed OUT of Britain, INTO China
- British East India Company needed something Chinese would buy
- The answer: opium from India

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "British East India Company tea trade China 18th century"
- Search: "Canton trade system painting" or "Thirteen Factories Guangzhou"
- Sources: British Museum, Hong Kong Maritime Museum

**Presenter Notes:**
- Frame this economically: Britain had a massive trade deficit with China
- Before opium, British paid for tea with silver—unsustainable
- Tea had become essential to British working-class diet (cheap calories, safe to drink)
- Opium reversed the silver flow: by 1830s, silver flowing OUT of China
- This was essentially state-sponsored drug trafficking

#### Slide 13: How the Opium Trade Worked
**Content:**
- British East India Company grew opium in India
- Company sold opium at auction in Calcutta
- Private British traders ("country traders") shipped to China
- Chinese smugglers distributed inland
- **Key fact:** Company kept hands "clean" while profiting enormously

**Popup Term: Canton System**
- Official trade system limiting Europeans to one port (Guangzhou/Canton)
- Foreign merchants confined to small area ("Thirteen Factories")
- All trade conducted through licensed Chinese merchants (Cohong)
- System maintained Chinese control—until opium undermined it

**Presenter Notes:**
- The two-step system gave Company legal deniability
- "We just sell opium in India—what happens after is not our concern"
- By 1838: ~40,000 chests (2.6 million pounds) entering China annually
- Enough to supply approximately 2 million addicts
- Silver drain was devastating: farmers had to pay taxes in silver, but earned copper
- Exchange rate shifted against ordinary Chinese—effective tax increase

#### Slide 14: Addiction's Toll
**Content:**
- Opium addiction spread through all levels of society:
  - Imperial clansmen and bannermen
  - Government officials
  - Merchants and laborers
  - Even some soldiers
- Addiction destroyed productivity and families
- Addicts sold possessions, children to feed habit
- Government debated: suppress or legalize and tax?

**Presenter Notes:**
- Read addiction accounts: chills, nausea, cramps when drug unavailable
- Addicts would "do almost anything" to maintain supply (textbook quote)
- Some officials actually proposed legalization—at least China could tax it
- But moral conservatives won the debate: opium was evil, must be stopped
- The problem: stopping it meant confronting Britain

#### Slide 15: Lin Zexu's Mission
**Content:**
- 1838: Daoguang Emperor appoints Lin Zexu as Special Commissioner
- Lin's approach:
  - Confiscate all opium in foreign hands
  - Demand merchants sign bonds promising never to trade opium again
  - Execute Chinese dealers
- Lin's assumption: moral pressure and firm action would work
- **March-June 1839:** Blockades foreign factories, seizes 20,000+ chests

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Lin Zexu portrait Qing official"
- Search: "Lin Zexu commissioner opium" 
- Sources: National Museum of China, historical photographs

**Presenter Notes:**
- Lin was genuinely impressive—not a fool or xenophobe
- He gathered intelligence on Britain, tried to understand enemy
- His famous letter to Queen Victoria appeals to morality: "You don't allow opium in Britain—why sell it to us?"
- But his worldview was still Confucian: virtue should triumph
- He didn't understand that Britain operated by different rules entirely

#### Slide 16: Why Gunboats Beat Junks
**Content:**
- British response: send warships and troops
- Technological gap was devastating:
  - Steam-powered warships vs. sail-powered junks
  - Long-range artillery vs. matchlock muskets
  - Professional navy vs. coastal defense militia
- **Example:** August 1841—British steamship destroys 9 war junks, 5 forts, 2 military stations in ONE DAY

**Popup Term: HMS Nemesis**
- Britain's first iron-hulled warship used in combat
- Shallow draft allowed it to sail up rivers
- Steam power meant it could ignore wind and currents
- Symbolized the Industrial Revolution's military applications
- Chinese had no equivalent and no way to build one

**Presenter Notes:**
- This wasn't just "better weapons"—it was entirely different military system
- British ships could appear anywhere along 2,000 miles of coastline
- Qing forces never knew where next attack would come
- Chinese soldiers fought bravely—many committed suicide rather than surrender
- But courage couldn't overcome systemic gap
- Lin Zexu was exiled in disgrace; the official who negotiated became the scapegoat

#### Slide 17: The Qing Collapse
**Content:**
- British seized city after city along coast
- 1842: British fleet reaches Nanjing
- Qing had no choice but to negotiate
- **Treaty of Nanjing** (August 29, 1842):
  - Pay 21 million silver dollars indemnity
  - Cede Hong Kong island to Britain
  - Open five ports to British trade
  - Abolish Canton system monopoly

**Presenter Notes:**
- Nanjing was the old Ming capital—profound symbolic humiliation
- The treaty was signed on a British warship in the harbor
- Terms dictated, not negotiated
- This was just the beginning—supplementary treaties added worse provisions
- Chinese negotiators actually thought they'd gotten off easy (just money and one island)
- They didn't yet understand the precedent they'd set

---

### SECTION 3: THE UNEQUAL TREATIES (Slides 18-23)
**[38:00–48:00] 10 minutes**

#### Slide 18: Section Header
**Content:**
- "The Unequal Treaty System: Sovereignty in Shreds"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: The Treaty of Nanjing was bad; what followed was worse
- Britain established a TEMPLATE that other powers would exploit
- China entered a system where it couldn't refuse new demands

#### Slide 19: Treaty of Nanjing Terms
**Content:**
- **Indemnity:** 21 million silver dollars (6 million for destroyed opium)
- **Territory:** Hong Kong ceded "in perpetuity"
- **Treaty Ports:** Canton, Amoy, Fuzhou, Ningbo, Shanghai
- **End of Canton System:** No more Cohong monopoly
- **Fixed tariffs:** China lost control of its own trade policy

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Treaty of Nanjing signing 1842 British ship"
- Search: "Treaty of Nanking HMS Cornwallis painting"
- Sources: National Maritime Museum Greenwich, Royal Museums Greenwich

**Presenter Notes:**
- Go through each term and explain why it mattered
- Indemnity: huge sum, had to raise taxes to pay it (more peasant suffering)
- Hong Kong: seemed like a "barren rock"—became major British base
- Treaty ports: foreign merchants now scattered along coast, harder to monitor
- Fixed tariffs: typically 5%—China couldn't use tariffs to protect domestic industry

#### Slide 20: The Treaty of the Bogue (1843)
**Content:**
- Supplementary treaty adding crucial provisions:
- **Extraterritoriality:** British subjects tried only in British courts
- **Most-favored-nation:** Any privilege given to ANY country automatically extended to Britain
- **These provisions became standard** in all future treaties

**Popup Term: Extraterritoriality**
- Foreign nationals exempt from local law
- If British citizen committed crime in China, tried in British court
- Signaled that Chinese law was "uncivilized"
- Lasted until 1943—over 100 years of humiliation
- Modern equivalent: imagine foreign soldiers in your country immune from your laws

**Popup Term: Most-Favored-Nation Clause**
- Any benefit granted to one treaty power automatically extends to all others
- Meant China couldn't play powers against each other
- Created "race to the bottom" in sovereignty
- Each new concession became universal
- The system was designed to be inescapable

**Presenter Notes:**
- Extraterritoriality was most insulting: implied Chinese justice was barbaric
- Most-favored-nation seemed harmless but was devastating strategically
- Every new treaty automatically worsened ALL previous treaties
- France, US, other powers quickly demanded same terms
- China entered a trap with no exit

#### Slide 21: What "Unequal Treaties" Meant
**Content:**
- Not "unequal" just because terms were harsh
- Structurally unequal because:
  - China had no reciprocal rights in European countries
  - Treaties could only be revised by MORE concessions
  - Most-favored-nation made resistance futile
  - Extraterritoriality denied Chinese sovereignty over own territory
- **This system lasted until 1943**

**Presenter Notes:**
- Emphasize: this wasn't one bad treaty, it was a SYSTEM
- Like quicksand: struggling made it worse
- Each time China lost a war, more concessions
- Each new concession automatically shared with all treaty powers
- This is why Chinese call this the "Century of Humiliation"
- The system only ended when US/UK needed China as WWII ally

#### Slide 22: Chinese Elite Response
**Content:**
- Immediate reactions:
  - Outrage at humiliation
  - Denial that it mattered ("barbarians will tire and leave")
  - Scapegoating (Lin Zexu exiled, negotiator condemned)
- Longer-term avoidance:
  - Court refused to accept foreign ambassadors as equals
  - Resisted implementing treaty terms
  - Hoped problem would go away
- **Result:** No serious reform for 20 years

**Presenter Notes:**
- The court's response was NOT stupid—it was culturally logical
- Confucian worldview: China was civilization's center
- "Barbarians" had come before (Mongols, Manchus)—eventually they assimilated
- Why would Europeans be different?
- But Europeans didn't WANT to become Chinese—they wanted to extract wealth
- This misunderstanding would cost another 20 years and another war

#### Slide 23: The Cixi Thread — A Girl in a Changing World
**Content:**
- In 1839, the future Empress Dowager Cixi was four years old
- Her father was a minor Manchu official
- Her family was respectable but not wealthy
- The banner system that had elevated her ancestors was now a burden
- **The world she would inherit was already breaking**

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Manchu bannerman family 19th century"
- Search: "Qing dynasty Manchu family photograph 1860s"
- Sources: Freer Gallery, Smithsonian Asian Art archives

**Presenter Notes:**
- Brief setup for Cixi thread that runs through all three lectures
- She was born into a system in decline but didn't yet know it
- Her path to power (entering the palace as low-ranking concubine) was one of few options for banner girls
- Preview: by the time she takes power in 1861, China will be fighting for survival
- Her choices—and constraints—will shape everything that follows

---

### ⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (Slide 24)
**[48:00–52:00] 4 minutes**

#### Slide 24: Pause & Process — Clashing Worldviews
**Content:**
- **Think-Pair-Share (3 minutes):**
- "The Qing saw themselves as the center of civilization."
- "The British saw themselves as bringing 'free trade' and 'progress.'"
- "How do these worldviews make negotiation almost impossible?"
- "Are there modern examples of clashing worldviews blocking communication?"

**Presenter Notes:**
- **Purpose:** Help students see Opium War as more than "good vs. evil"
- **What you're doing:**
  1. 90 seconds individual thought
  2. 90 seconds pair discussion
  3. Solicit 2-3 responses
- **Expected responses:**
  - Both sides thought they were right/civilized
  - Neither could understand the other's logic
  - Modern examples: globalization debates, cultural imperialism accusations
- **Key insight:** Neither side was "crazy"—they operated from incompatible premises
- **Transition to wrap-up:** "So who was right? Or is that the wrong question?"

---

### WRAP-UP AND PREVIEW (Slides 25-27)
**[52:00–55:00] 3 minutes**

#### Slide 25: Key Takeaways
**Content:**
- The Opium War struck an empire ALREADY in crisis:
  - Population outstripping resources
  - Fiscal system failing
  - Military decayed
  - Manchu elite blocking reform
- The war didn't CAUSE these problems—it EXPOSED them
- And it created a treaty system that would bleed China for a century

**Presenter Notes:**
- Synthesize the lecture's main argument: internal AND external factors
- Neither alone explains China's trajectory
- The combination was devastating
- This framing will continue through all three lectures

#### Slide 26: Looking Ahead
**Content:**
- **Next lecture:** The Taiping Rebellion
- A failed examination candidate who believed he was Jesus's brother
- 20-30 million dead—the bloodiest civil war in human history
- What happens when a broken system finally BREAKS?

**Presenter Notes:**
- Tease the drama of Hong Xiuquan's story
- The Taiping will show what was broken INSIDE China
- Preview: the Taiping Rebellion will force the dynasty to rebuild—but the cost will be enormous
- Connection: the unemployed boatmen, the desperate young men, the religious seekers—they all become Taiping fodder

#### Slide 27: Key Terms Review
**Content:**
- **Cohong system** — Licensed Chinese merchants controlling foreign trade at Canton
- **Lin Zexu** — Commissioner who destroyed opium and triggered war
- **Treaty of Nanjing (1842)** — First "unequal treaty" ending Opium War
- **Extraterritoriality** — Foreigners exempt from Chinese law
- **Most-favored-nation** — Privileges granted to one power extend to all

**Presenter Notes:**
- Quick review of terms students should know
- These will appear on exams
- Encourage students to use popup definitions when reviewing slides

## PRIMARY SOURCE OPTIONS

**Lin Zexu's Letter to Queen Victoria (1839) — Excerpts:**

> "We have heard that in your honorable nation, too, the people are not permitted to inhale the drug. If it is admittedly so deleterious, how can seeking profit by exposing others to its malefic power be reconciled with the maxims of heaven?... Let us suppose that foreigners came from another country and brought opium into England and seduced the people of your country to smoke it. Would not you, the sovereign of the said country, look upon such a procedure with anger and in your just indignation endeavor to get rid of it?"

**Use:** Shows Lin's moral logic and his attempt to appeal to shared values—and why it failed

## TEACHING NOTES

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
1. "China was backward" — No, China was wealthy and sophisticated; problems were structural
2. "The British were simply evil" — More complex: they believed in free trade ideology
3. "Lin Zexu was naive" — No, he was intelligent but operating from different premises
4. "Opium caused China's decline" — No, opium worsened existing problems

**Discussion Strategies:**
- Use economic framing to make trade issues concrete
- Compare to modern drug policy debates (without false equivalence)
- Ask students to imagine negotiations between parties with incompatible worldviews

**Connections to Make:**
- Link to Chapter 16's High Qing prosperity—what changed?
- Preview Taiping Rebellion's roots in the social crisis described here
- Note: Cixi thread continues through all three lectures

**Timing Notes:**
- Section 1 (Empire at 1800) may run long—can trim Slide 6 if needed
- Pause & Process #1 is crucial for connecting material to students' experience
- Section 3 (Unequal Treaties) can be compressed if time short—key terms are essential
