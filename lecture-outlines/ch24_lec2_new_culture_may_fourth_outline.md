### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain why Chinese intellectuals attacked Confucianism as the root cause of China's weakness
2. Analyze the New Culture Movement's radical proposals for transforming Chinese society and culture
3. Evaluate the significance of the May Fourth Movement as a turning point in modern Chinese history
4. Compare different intellectual responses to China's crisis—liberalism, anarchism, socialism, and nationalism

---

### Lecture Theme

While warlords fought over political power, a generation of young intellectuals launched an even more radical revolution—a revolution of the mind. The New Culture Movement attacked not just the Qing Dynasty but the entire Confucian tradition that had shaped Chinese civilization for two millennia. These intellectuals believed that China could not become strong until Chinese people transformed themselves. This lecture examines their iconoclastic critique and the explosive political awakening it produced.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow Lu Xun (1881-1936), China's greatest modern writer, whose journey from failed medical student to fierce cultural critic encapsulates the New Culture generation's disillusionment and determination. Lu Xun's short story "Diary of a Madman" (1918)—the first modern Chinese story written entirely in vernacular Chinese—serves as our entry point into understanding why these intellectuals believed Chinese culture was, quite literally, eating its own children.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Interpreting the May Fourth Movement:** Historians have interpreted May Fourth very differently depending on their political perspective. In mainland China, official history emphasizes May Fourth as the beginning of the communist revolution. In Taiwan, the Nationalist tradition claims it as a patriotic but anti-communist movement. Liberal intellectuals see it as China's incomplete Enlightenment. Vera Schwarcz's *The Chinese Enlightenment* (1986) argued that May Fourth represented a genuine Chinese enlightenment movement brutally interrupted by war and revolution. We'll examine how these competing interpretations reflect different hopes for China's future.

## OPENING: A Madman's Diagnosis (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display the opening lines of Lu Xun's "Diary of a Madman" (in translation)

Begin by reading aloud:

*"I used to believe the statements that the twenty-four dynastic histories were simply 'records of mutual slaughter' or 'family histories of rulers.' Later, when I read them for myself, I realized this was a fallacy... All these histories portray the soul of China and indicate what the country's future will be, but the truth is buried so deep in flowery phrases and nonsense... If we compare the events recorded during the Five Dynasties period or the Southern Song Dynasty with modern conditions, it is amazing how alike they are. It seems as if China alone is untouched by the passage of time."*

**Opening Question:** "What do you think the author is suggesting about Chinese history and Chinese culture?"

[Allow students to respond]

**Then reveal:** This is from Lu Xun's essay "Sudden Notions," published in February 1925. Lu Xun was arguing that Chinese history was a repeating cycle of the same failures—and that China would never change until Chinese people confronted this truth.

**But his most famous critique was even more shocking.** Read from "Diary of a Madman" (1918):

*"I have only just realized that I have been living all these years in a place where for four thousand years they have been eating human flesh."*

**Transition:** The narrator is supposed to be insane—the story's title tells us that. But Lu Xun's Chinese readers understood: the madman was the only one seeing clearly. Chinese civilization, Lu Xun suggested, was a system that devoured its children through suffocating tradition, arranged marriages, filial demands, and rigid hierarchy. This shocking metaphor—Confucian civilization as cannibalism—captured the mood of an entire generation.

**Preview:** Today we examine why young Chinese intellectuals turned so ferociously against their own cultural heritage, what alternatives they proposed, and how their cultural revolution became a political earthquake.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: Why Attack Confucius? (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Setting the Scene:**
The 1911 Revolution had overthrown the emperor, but what had changed? Warlords still ruled by force. Local elites still dominated villages. Young people still married whomever their parents chose. Women still had their feet bound. Most Chinese were still illiterate.

**The New Culture intellectuals asked a radical question:** What if China's problem wasn't just bad government, but Chinese culture itself?

**Introducing Chen Duxiu and New Youth Magazine:**
In 1915, Chen Duxiu—a scholar who had studied in Japan and France—founded a magazine called *New Youth* (Xin Qingnian). Its message was explosive.

**[Click slide: Cover of New Youth magazine]**

In the very first issue, Chen declared war on traditional values:

*"Youth is like early spring, like the rising sun, like trees and grass in bud... Youth should be progressive, not conservative; creative, not imitative."*

He urged young people not to waste their "fleeting time in arguing with the old and rotten."

**The Attack on Confucianism:**
Chen and his allies identified Confucianism as the enemy of progress. Why?

**[Instructor note: This section works well as interactive lecture. Ask students what they remember about Confucian values from earlier lectures, then show how New Culture intellectuals reframed each value negatively.]**

- **Filial piety** → blind obedience that crushed individual initiative
- **Respect for elders** → gerontocracy that prevented change
- **Harmony** → conformity that silenced dissent
- **Rituals and propriety** → meaningless forms that trapped people in outdated roles
- **The family system** → prison for women and youth

**A Specific Example—Arranged Marriage:**
New Culture writers filled magazines with stories of young people destroyed by arranged marriages. Consider: a woman might be betrothed as an infant to a man she'd never meet until her wedding day. If he died before the marriage, she was still expected to remain "faithful" to his memory—essentially becoming a widow before ever being a wife. If she lived to marry and her husband died young, remarriage was shameful. Such "chaste widows" were celebrated in imperial records.

**[Click slide: Image of Qing-era "chaste widow" memorial arch]**

The New Culture writers asked: Who was being honored here? The woman, or the system that sacrificed her?

**Yuan Shikai's Confucian Revival:**
The stakes became personal when Yuan Shikai, the man who had destroyed the republic, attempted to make Confucianism the state religion in 1915 before declaring himself emperor. For New Culture intellectuals, this proved their point: Confucianism wasn't just outdated—it was the ideological weapon of tyrants.

### Segment 2: Mr. Science and Mr. Democracy (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 19 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** If Confucianism was the disease, what was the cure? The New Culture Movement's answer was famously summarized as "Mr. Science" (赛先生, Sai Xiansheng) and "Mr. Democracy" (德先生, De Xiansheng).

**Why These Metaphors?**
Chen Duxiu personified these concepts to make them accessible and to suggest they were foreign guests who could teach China new ways of thinking.

**Mr. Science:**
Science meant more than laboratories and experiments. It meant:
- Thinking based on evidence rather than tradition
- Questioning received wisdom
- Rejecting superstition and supernatural explanations
- Applying reason to social problems

The May Fourth generation believed that scientific thinking could analyze social problems just as it analyzed natural phenomena. Poverty, ignorance, weakness—these weren't fate or karma, but problems that could be solved through rational investigation.

**Mr. Democracy:**
Democracy meant more than just elections. It meant:
- Individual rights against family and state
- Freedom of thought and expression
- Equality—including between men and women
- Government accountable to citizens

**Western Visitors Validate the Movement:**
The movement gained credibility when famous Western intellectuals visited China. John Dewey, the American philosopher of progressive education, lectured throughout China in 1919-1921. Bertrand Russell followed in 1920-1921, as did Margaret Sanger promoting birth control. The educator John Dewey was particularly impressed by Chinese students' eagerness, commenting that nowhere in the world were students "so unanimously and so eagerly interested in what is modern and new in thought."

**The Language Revolution:**
Perhaps the most lasting reform was linguistic. Hu Shi (胡适), a young scholar trained at Cornell and Columbia, argued that Chinese should write in the vernacular—the language people actually spoke—rather than the classical literary language that took years to master and that only a tiny educated elite could read.

**[Instructor note: Explain this is comparable to if all formal English writing still used Latin or Middle English. The classical/vernacular divide was that extreme.]**

In 1921, the Ministry of Education officially adopted vernacular Chinese for school textbooks. This single reform did more to democratize knowledge than any political revolution.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "The New Culture intellectuals blamed traditional Chinese culture for China's problems. Do you think this self-criticism was productive or destructive? Can you think of other examples where societies have engaged in radical cultural self-criticism?"

[Allow brief pair discussion, then take 1-2 responses]

**Possible connections:** Post-WWII Germany's reckoning with Nazi past, post-Civil Rights America's examination of racism, decolonization movements rejecting colonial cultures

### Segment 3: Lu Xun—The Writer as Surgeon (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Returning to Our Central Story:**
No figure embodied the New Culture Movement's spirit more powerfully than Lu Xun (鲁迅, original name Zhou Shuren).

**A Doctor's Diagnosis:**
Lu Xun trained as a medical doctor in Japan. But in 1906, something happened that changed his life. During a lantern slide show, he saw a photograph of Chinese spectators calmly watching Japanese soldiers execute a Chinese man accused of spying for Russia. Lu Xun was haunted not by the execution but by the faces of the Chinese watchers—passive, apparently indifferent.

**[Click slide: Lu Xun portrait]**

*"The people of a weak and backward country, however strong and healthy they might be, could only serve to be made examples of... The most important thing was to change their spirit."*

Lu Xun abandoned medicine for literature. He would be a spiritual doctor, healing Chinese souls.

**"Diary of a Madman" (1918):**
His first vernacular story shocked readers. A man descends into "madness," but his madness consists of seeing Chinese society clearly for the first time. He realizes that Confucian civilization—with its emphasis on "eating" people metaphorically through ritual, hierarchy, and forced conformity—is literal cannibalism. The story ends with the famous plea:

*"Save the children..."*

**"The True Story of Ah Q" (1921):**
Lu Xun's masterpiece follows a dim-witted village nobody who responds to every humiliation by convincing himself he has actually achieved a "spiritual victory." Ah Q was a devastating portrait of Chinese national character—the capacity for self-deception, the acceptance of injustice, the lack of genuine revolutionary consciousness.

**Why Lu Xun Matters:**
Lu Xun gave the New Culture Movement its most powerful voice—not dry argument but vivid fiction that forced readers to see themselves. His work remains required reading in Chinese schools today, though different political systems have interpreted him very differently.

### Segment 4: The May Fourth Explosion (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 40 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** The New Culture Movement was primarily an intellectual affair, confined to students and professors in major cities. The May Fourth Movement transformed it into a mass political awakening.

**The Trigger—Versailles:**
During World War I, China had supported the Allies, sending 140,000 laborers to France to dig trenches and unload ships. Chinese hoped this contribution would earn them a seat at the peace table and return of German-held territories in Shandong province.

Instead, the Versailles Treaty awarded Germany's Chinese territories to Japan—the very Japan whose Twenty-One Demands in 1915 had sought to make China a virtual protectorate.

**[Click slide: Map showing German concessions in Shandong]**

The news arrived in Beijing on May 1, 1919.

**May 4th, 1919:**
Three days later, some 3,000 students assembled at Tiananmen Square—the plaza in front of the old imperial palace. They marched to the foreign legation quarter, shouting patriotic slogans. When they couldn't reach the foreign diplomats, they turned on Chinese officials who had cooperated with Japan, beating a cabinet minister and setting fire to the home of a pro-Japanese official.

The police arrested the ringleaders. But this time, something unprecedented happened.

**The Movement Spreads:**
Teachers, workers, merchants, and ordinary citizens rallied to the students' cause. Within weeks, strikes closed schools in more than two hundred cities. In Shanghai, workers struck, merchants boycotted Japanese goods, and students gave speeches on street corners. The Beijing government, facing national paralysis, released the arrested students.

**[Click slide: May Fourth demonstrators photograph]**

China refused to sign the Versailles Treaty.

**The Significance of May Fourth:**
Why does May Fourth matter so much?

1. **Students as political actors:** For the first time, students emerged as a major political force—a role they would play repeatedly throughout the twentieth century
2. **Mass nationalism:** The movement mobilized ordinary Chinese who had never engaged in politics
3. **The power of boycotts:** Economic nationalism—refusing to buy Japanese goods—became a political weapon
4. **Women's participation:** Women joined protests in significant numbers for the first time
5. **Radicalization:** The failure of Wilsonian self-determination pushed many intellectuals toward more radical solutions—including Soviet communism

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 50 minutes into class]**

**Quick-Write Prompt:** "The May Fourth protestors were angry at both foreign imperialism AND Chinese weakness. How did these two targets of anger relate to each other? Could you be patriotic and self-critical at the same time?"

[Students jot down thoughts for 2 minutes]

## CLOSING: The Fork in the Road (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
The New Culture Movement and May Fourth created a generation convinced that China needed fundamental transformation. But transformation into what? By the early 1920s, Chinese intellectuals were pursuing very different answers:

- **Liberals** like Hu Shi believed in gradual reform through education
- **Nationalists** focused on building a strong Chinese state
- **Communists** saw class revolution as the only solution

**Looking Forward:**
The Soviet Union's new Bolshevik government was the only major power that renounced its unequal treaties with China. This gesture had enormous impact. Next time, we'll see how Sun Yatsen rebuilt his movement with Soviet help, how Chiang Kaishek launched the Northern Expedition to reunify China, and how the hopes of May Fourth led ultimately to civil war.

**Closing Thought:**
Lu Xun, characteristically pessimistic, refused to promise happy endings. He wrote: "Hope cannot be said to exist, nor can it be said not to exist. It is just like roads across the earth. For actually the earth had no roads to begin with, but when many people pass one way, a road is made."

The May Fourth generation had begun making a road. Where it would lead remained to be seen.
