# LECTURE 1: The Manchu Rise and Conquest of China

**50 minutes | Focus: How did the Manchus transform from a small tribal federation to conquerors of all China?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
The Manchus numbered perhaps 1 million people. China had a population of about 175 million. How did such a small group conquer and rule the world's largest empire for nearly 300 years?

### 2. **Manchu Origins and Early Organization** (11 minutes):
- **Jurchens**: Lived in Manchuria, economy based on fishing, hunting, animal husbandry, farming
- Spoke language related to Tungusic, had been in regular contact with Tang Chinese and Khitan
- **Multiethnic kingdom of Balhae** in southern Manchuria (see Chapter 6)
- Ming called them "Jurchens," reminded Chinese of Jurchens who founded Jin Dynasty (1115, Chapter 8)
- Raised cattle and horses, moving herds in nomadic fashion
- Some bred near Chinese (Khitan, Goryeo/Korean borders)
- Had been selling Khitans horses since mid-10th century
- In early 12th century, Wanyan clan united 8-10 Jurchen tribes under leadership
- By mid-12th century, Jurchens were selling Khitans 10,000 horses/year
- During mid-late 11th century, Wanyan clan gained dominant position
- **1115**: Wanyan Aguda challenged Liao authority, Jurchens began challenging Liao overlordship
- In 1115, Jurchens established their own dynasty, Jin (Golden)

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: The Manchus learned from earlier steppe conquerors (Khitan, Jurchen, Mongol). What lessons might they have learned about ruling China?

### 4. **Nurhaci and the Banner System** (12 minutes):
- Late 16th century: Jurchen leaders began consolidating power
- **Nurhaci (1559-1626)** emerged as paramount leader
- Organized Jurchens into **eight banners** (military-social units)
- Each banner identified by colored flag
- Banner included warriors, their families, and slaves
- System created identity beyond kinship
- Provided framework for military mobilization and social organization
- **1599: Nurhaci ordered creation of Manchu script** (adapted from Mongolian)
- Could write in Manchu, Mongol, and Chinese
- **1616: Declared himself khan of Later Jin Dynasty**
- 1618: Announced Seven Great Grievances against Ming, began direct military confrontation
- Captured Ming strongholds in Manchuria
- **1625: Moved capital to Shenyang**
- 1626: Nurhaci injured in battle, died soon after

### 5. **Hong Taiji and Qing Establishment** (10 minutes):
- Nurhaci's son **Hong Taiji (1592-1643)** succeeded
- Continued military expansion
- **Reorganized banner system**: Added Mongol banners and Chinese banners
- Now had **24 banners** total (8 Manchu, 8 Mongol, 8 Chinese)
- Hereditary succession within Xiao Clan (Nurhaci's clan) and Yelu Clan
- These two clans dominated higher reaches of government
- Both emperor and high officials flogged in open court (Jurchen tradition)
- **1636: Hong Taiji proclaimed Qing Dynasty** (replaced "Jin" name)
- Claimed Mandate of Heaven, positioned as legitimate rulers of China
- "Qing" means "pure" or "clear"
- **Relationship with Mongols crucial**:
  - Married Mongol noblewomen
  - 1636: Invited Dalai Lama to visit Mongolia
  - Khan declared Tibetan Buddhism official religion for all Mongols
  - Dalai Lama gave khan title "King of Religion"
  - Khan swore Mongols would renounce blood sacrifice
  - When third Dalai Lama reincarnated (1557-1619), found to be great-grandson of Altan Khan
  - Ties between Tibet and Mongols, NOT surprisingly, became even stronger
- **Hong Taiji's diplomatic skills**: Managed Mongol relations, Korean relations, prepared for China conquest
- 1643: Hong Taiji died suddenly; son Fulin only 5 years old

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: The banner system incorporated Mongols and Chinese as equals. Why was this multi-ethnic organization important for conquest and rule?

### 7. **Conquest of Ming China** (8 minutes):
- 1644: **Li Zicheng captured Beijing**, Ming emperor committed suicide
- Ming general **Wu Sangui** stationed at Shanhai Pass (Great Wall)
- Faced dilemma: Submit to rebels or seek Manchu help?
- Wu decided to ally with Manchus against Li Zicheng
- **Dorgon** (Hong Taiji's brother, regent for young emperor) led Manchu forces through pass
- Combined Manchu-Wu forces defeated Li Zicheng
- Manchus entered Beijing as "rescuers" of Ming legitimacy
- Promised to avenge Ming emperor's death
- **Young Shunzhi Emperor (r. 1644-1661)** installed in Forbidden City
- But conquest far from over:
  - Southern Ming loyalists held out in south for decades
  - **Conquest took until 1680s**
  - Had to defeat Ming loyalists, pacify regions, establish control
- Key factors in Manchu success:
  - Banner system (multiethnic military machine)
  - Wu Sangui and other Chinese collaborators
  - Claimed Ming legitimacy (avenging last emperor)
  - Willingness to adopt Chinese institutions

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Manchus succeeded where others failed because they created a multiethnic coalition, claimed Chinese legitimacy, and showed political sophistication. Next lecture: How did the early Qing emperors consolidate control and create a prosperous, stable empire?

**Big Question**: Was the Manchu conquest of China inevitable after 1644, or could the Ming have been restored? What made the Manchus different from earlier conquerors?
