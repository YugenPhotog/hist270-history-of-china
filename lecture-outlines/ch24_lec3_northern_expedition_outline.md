# LECTURE 3: Marching North
## The Rise of the Nationalists and the Reunification of China (1920-1927)

**Total Lecture Time:** 50 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain why Sun Yatsen turned to the Soviet Union for assistance in rebuilding the Nationalist Party
2. Analyze the alliance between the Nationalists and Communists and the tensions within it
3. Evaluate Chiang Kaishek's role in the Northern Expedition and the reunification of China
4. Assess the significance of the 1927 Shanghai massacre for Chinese political development

---

### Lecture Theme

The ideas unleashed by the New Culture Movement and May Fourth demanded political expression. This lecture traces how Sun Yatsen rebuilt his shattered Nationalist Party with Soviet help, how a fragile alliance between Nationalists and Communists launched the Northern Expedition to reunify China, and how that alliance ended in bloody betrayal. By 1927, China had achieved a nominal reunification—but at the cost of a civil war that would shape the rest of the century.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow Chiang Kaishek's transformation from an obscure military aide studying in Moscow to the most powerful man in China. Chiang's journey—from revolutionary idealist to ruthless anti-communist—illuminates how the hopes of May Fourth generation gave way to authoritarian nationalism. His decision to massacre his communist allies in Shanghai in April 1927 ended one revolutionary possibility and began another.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Nationalist vs. Communist Narratives:** The events of 1924-1927 have been interpreted very differently depending on political perspective. Nationalist (Kuomintang) historians portrayed Chiang Kaishek as a patriot who saved China from communist subversion. Communist Party historians depicted the Shanghai massacre as a counterrevolutionary betrayal that necessitated armed revolution. Recent scholarship has moved beyond these partisan framings to examine the genuine tensions within the united front and the social forces driving both parties. We'll examine how this period became foundational mythology for both Chinese states.

## OPENING: An Unlikely Alliance (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display photograph of Sun Yatsen with Soviet advisers

Begin with a question that frames the lecture's central puzzle:

**Opening Question:** "By 1920, Sun Yatsen had failed in multiple attempts to build a revolutionary movement. The Western democracies ignored him. His own country was fragmented among warlords. Where would you turn for help?"

[Allow students to speculate]

**Reveal the answer:** Sun turned to the only major power that offered assistance—Soviet Russia.

In 1922, Sun met with Soviet representative Adolf Joffe in Shanghai. The resulting agreement was remarkable: the Soviet Union would provide military advisers, weapons, and organizational expertise to help the Nationalists reunify China. In return, the Chinese Communist Party would join the Nationalist Party as individuals, creating a "united front."

**The Irony:**
This was strange bedfellows indeed. Sun Yatsen was not a communist—he explicitly rejected class struggle. The Soviets acknowledged that China was not ready for communist revolution. Yet Moscow calculated that helping Chinese nationalism would weaken the imperialist powers and expand Soviet influence.

**Preview:** Today we trace how this unlikely alliance conquered China—and then tore itself apart in one of the bloodiest betrayals of the twentieth century.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: Rebuilding the Revolution (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Sun Yatsen's Situation by 1920:**
A decade after the 1911 Revolution, Sun Yatsen had little to show for his efforts. His Nationalist Party (Guomindang, GMD) controlled only a precarious base in Guangdong province. He had no reliable army—regional commanders came and went based on self-interest. He had no mass organization. He had failed repeatedly to extend his power beyond the south.

**Why the Soviet Appeal:**
The Soviet Union offered what no one else would:
- **Military advisers:** Experienced officers who could train a disciplined party army
- **Organizational expertise:** The Leninist party model that had enabled the Bolsheviks to seize power
- **An ideology of anti-imperialism:** The Soviets had renounced the unequal treaties, gaining enormous goodwill
- **Financial support:** Money for weapons and organizing

**The Whampoa Military Academy:**
In 1924, with Soviet help, Sun established the Whampoa Military Academy near Guangzhou. Soviet adviser Michael Borodin helped reorganize the Nationalist Party along Leninist lines—with a central committee, party cells, and strict discipline.

**[Click slide: Photograph of Whampoa Military Academy]**

The academy's first commandant was a young officer named Chiang Kaishek.

**Introducing Chiang Kaishek:**
Chiang (Jiang Jieshi, 1887-1975) had impressive revolutionary credentials. From a salt merchant family in Zhejiang province, he had attended military school in Japan, joined Sun's revolutionary movement early, and participated in the 1911 Revolution. After Sun's return to Guangzhou, Chiang became his military aide.

**[Instructor note: Students should understand that "Chiang Kaishek" is the Cantonese romanization, while "Jiang Jieshi" is Mandarin. Use whichever is in your textbook, but explain the discrepancy.]**

In 1923, Sun sent Chiang to Moscow for several months of study. Chiang observed Soviet methods closely—but came away deeply suspicious of communist intentions.

**The United Front:**
Under Soviet guidance, the Chinese Communist Party (founded in 1921, with about 300 members) joined the Nationalist Party as individuals. Key communists took important positions: Zhou Enlai became deputy director of Whampoa's political department, Mao Zedong worked in the GMD propaganda department.

The Soviets assured both parties this was temporary—Nationalists would lead the "bourgeois democratic" revolution, communists would wait for the later socialist stage.

**Key Point:** The united front worked because both parties needed each other. The GMD gained organizational expertise and Soviet backing. The CCP gained access to a mass movement and military training. But neither party trusted the other.

### Segment 2: The Death of Sun and Rise of Chiang (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 19 minutes into class]**

**Sun Yatsen's Final Months:**
In late 1924, Sun traveled north for negotiations with the warlord who controlled Beijing—hoping to achieve reunification through diplomacy rather than war. But Sun was already ill with cancer. He died in Beijing on March 12, 1925, at age 58.

His deathbed statement urged his followers to continue the revolution: "The revolution is not yet complete. My comrades must continue to work for its success."

**[Click slide: Sun Yatsen in final illness, 1925]**

**Power Struggle:**
Sun's death opened a succession struggle. The Nationalist left wing, sympathetic to closer Soviet ties, competed with the right wing, suspicious of communist infiltration. In this contest, Chiang Kaishek steadily accumulated power.

**The May 30th Movement (1925):**
Just two months after Sun's death, an incident galvanized nationalist sentiment across China. On May 30, Shanghai police under British command fired on Chinese demonstrators protesting the killing of a Chinese worker at a Japanese mill. Thirteen died.

The May 30th Movement that followed dwarfed even May Fourth. Strikes paralyzed Shanghai for months. In Guangzhou, a sympathy strike against the British-controlled enclave of Hong Kong lasted fifteen months.

**[Click slide: May 30th Movement protesters photograph]**

**Why This Mattered:**
The May 30th Movement demonstrated mass support for anti-imperialist nationalism—exactly what the Nationalists and Communists were organizing around. It also radicalized many workers, strengthening Communist influence in the labor movement.

**Chiang Consolidates Power:**
In March 1926, Chiang launched a preemptive strike against his leftist rivals. Claiming to have discovered a Communist plot (evidence for which remains disputed), he arrested Communist-aligned officers, placed Soviet advisers under surveillance, and demanded restrictions on Communist influence.

The Soviets and Chinese Communists, desperate to preserve the united front, accepted Chiang's terms. It was a fateful concession.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "The Communists accepted restrictions on their power rather than break with Chiang in March 1926. Was this wise? What might have happened if they had refused?"

[Allow brief pair discussion]

**Key insight:** The Communists were following Moscow's orders, which prioritized preserving the united front. In hindsight, this proved catastrophic—but at the time, the CCP was too small and weak to survive on its own.

### Segment 3: The Northern Expedition (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Launching the Campaign:**
On July 9, 1926, Chiang Kaishek launched the Northern Expedition—a military campaign to defeat the warlords and reunify China under Nationalist rule.

**[Click slide: Map showing Northern Expedition route]**

The Nationalist forces were remarkably small—perhaps 85,000 troops against warlord armies numbering in the millions. But they had crucial advantages:
- Soviet weapons and training
- Disciplined, politically motivated officers
- Popular support for their nationalist message
- Communist organizers who stirred up workers and peasants ahead of the army

**A Revolutionary Army:**
Unlike warlord armies that looted and abused civilians, the Nationalist forces were trained to treat civilians decently (at least initially). Political commissars—many of them Communists—explained the revolution's goals to soldiers and civilians alike.

The army advanced rapidly. Wuhan fell in October 1926. By early 1927, the Nationalists controlled much of central China.

**The Role of Mass Movements:**
What made the Northern Expedition different from previous warlord campaigns was the popular mobilization that accompanied it:
- **Workers:** In cities along the route, underground organizers prepared strikes that paralyzed enemy forces
- **Peasants:** In the countryside, peasant associations organized by Communists rose against landlords
- **Students:** Propaganda teams spread the revolutionary message

**Mao Zedong's "Hunan Report":**
In early 1927, Mao Zedong investigated the peasant movement in Hunan province. His report was electrifying—and terrifying to the Nationalist right wing:

*"In a very short time, several hundred million peasants in China's central, southern, and northern provinces will rise like a fierce wind or tempest... They will smash all the trammels that bind them and rush forward along the road to liberation."*

Mao celebrated peasant violence against landlords as revolutionary justice. But such radicalism alarmed the Nationalist leadership—many of whom came from landlord families themselves.

**Tensions Rise:**
By early 1927, the united front was fracturing. The Nationalist left wing, based in Wuhan, supported continued cooperation with the Communists. Chiang Kaishek, controlling the military, moved toward Shanghai—and toward a decisive break.

### Segment 4: Blood in Shanghai (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 42 minutes into class]**

**The Stakes in Shanghai:**
Shanghai was the prize everyone wanted. China's largest city, commercial capital, home to a militant labor movement—whoever controlled Shanghai controlled China's economic heart.

In March 1927, as Chiang's forces approached, Communist-led workers staged an armed uprising. Within days, they controlled most of the Chinese areas of the city, delivering Shanghai to the Nationalists on a silver platter.

**The Betrayal:**
What happened next remains one of the most controversial events in modern Chinese history.

On April 12, 1927—at 4 AM—armed men attacked Communist positions throughout Shanghai. The attackers were the "Green Gang"—Shanghai's most powerful criminal organization—acting in coordination with Chiang's forces. Police and soldiers joined in.

**[Click slide: Aftermath of April 1927 Shanghai massacre]**

The killing continued for days. Communists, labor organizers, and anyone suspected of leftist sympathies were hunted down. Estimates of the dead range from hundreds to thousands.

**"White Terror":**
The Shanghai massacre was the opening of what Communists called the "White Terror." Similar purges followed in cities across Nationalist-controlled territory. The Communist Party, which had grown to perhaps 60,000 members, was decimated. Many surviving leaders fled to the countryside or abroad.

**Why Did Chiang Do It?**
Historians have offered various explanations:
- **Ideological:** Chiang genuinely feared communist revolution
- **Class interest:** The Shanghai business elite and foreign powers demanded suppression of labor radicalism
- **Power politics:** The Communists were rivals for control of the revolution
- **Financial:** Shanghai bankers offered loans in exchange for destroying the labor movement

**The Wuhan Government Follows:**
The leftist Nationalist government in Wuhan initially condemned Chiang. But within months, they too expelled their Communist members. By the end of 1927, the united front was dead.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 52 minutes into class]**

**Quick Reflection:** "The April 1927 massacre ended any possibility of peaceful cooperation between Nationalists and Communists. From this point on, their conflict would be resolved only by civil war. What alternatives, if any, might have existed?"

[Students reflect briefly]

## CLOSING: The Morning After (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 3 minutes]**

**Reunification Achieved—At What Cost?**
By 1927, China was nominally reunified under the Nationalist government. In 1928, Nationalist forces entered Beijing, completing the Northern Expedition. Foreign powers recognized Chiang's government.

**What Had Changed:**
Compared to the chaos of the warlord era, the Nationalist government brought genuine improvements:
- A functioning central government
- Modern legal codes
- Infrastructure development (roads, railways)
- Recognition of China's sovereignty
- Trained military forces

**What Had Not Changed:**
But the revolution remained incomplete:
- Many warlords were simply absorbed into the Nationalist system
- Land reform never happened
- Rural China remained impoverished
- Dissent was brutally suppressed
- The Communist Party, driven underground, would rise again

**Looking Forward:**
The events of 1927 set the stage for the next quarter-century of Chinese history. The Communists who survived the White Terror—including Mao Zedong—concluded that armed revolution was the only path to power. They would retreat to the countryside, build peasant armies, and eventually triumph in 1949.

**The Shadow of April:**
Chiang Kaishek would rule China (and later Taiwan) for nearly fifty years. But the violence of April 1927 haunted his legacy. The Communist Party, which came to power promising "liberation" from Nationalist oppression, built its founding mythology around the martyrs of 1927.

**Closing Thought:**
The May Fourth generation had dreamed of a modern, democratic China that would stand proud among nations. By 1927, they had achieved part of that dream—national reunification and international recognition. But democracy remained elusive, and the question of what kind of society China would become was left to be settled by the barrel of a gun.
