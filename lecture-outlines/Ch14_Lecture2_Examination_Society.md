# LECTURE 2: The Examination System and Ming Society

**50 minutes | Focus: How did the expansion of education and the examination system shape Ming culture, society, and intellectual life?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
A young man fails the jinshi exam four times. In his dream, he sees his whole life flash by: He passes on the fifth try, rises to high office, is slandered and condemned to death, then cleared and promoted. At his dinner party, he wakes up and realizes life passes as quickly as a dream. Why were the examinations so important?

### 2. **The Examination System Expanded** (11 minutes):
- Ming made examination system MORE important than Song
- **Three degrees**: shengyuan (county/prefecture), juren (province), jinshi (capital + palace)
- Added screening test at province level
- Three sessions over a week, candidates in individual cells
- First session: Four Books passages + Classic of Filial Piety
- Second/third sessions: Policy issues, judicial rulings, dynastic histories
- **Timing**: county/prefectural tests periodically to retain status (30,000 shengyuan by 1500)
- Capital to take juren (149/year in Southern Song, now permanently qualified for lower appointments)
- Palace examination (89/year Song, similar Ming average)
- 1427 on: examiners considered regional origin for balance (northerners ensured 35 percent)
- **New first level institutionalized**, regional quotas
- Result: About 1 in 333 chance at county level, intense lifetime competition

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: Why would someone take the same exam over and over for decades, often never passing? What does this tell us about social mobility and ambition?

### 4. **Examination Preparation** (10 minutes):
- Education best started young (age 4-5)
- Usually more adept at memorizing long texts when young
- Calligraphy training essential (tests not recopied by clerks until province level)
- As in earlier periods, tutors for boys, schools more available
- Families that for generations had other careers (physician, merchant) had more opportunities
- **Lineages especially active**: Setting up and endowing schools, sometimes for members only, sometimes for talented boys
- Provincial and capital examinations weeklong affairs
- 5,000-10,000 candidates descended on city, filled hostels
- Candidates brought supplies: paper, ink, brushes, candles, blankets, food
- Searched before admission (no materials could be taken in)
- Caught wearing cheat-sheet lost status as shengyuan
- Exam had three two-day sessions
- Clerks recopied and assigned numbers for anonymity
- Proofreaders checked copying before handing to examiners
- Grading took about 20 days
- **Result**: Most stayed in provincial capital to await results
- Few who became new juren invited to governor's compound for celebration
- Most reached home to find friends/neighbors/relatives already heard the good news

### 5. **Educational and Intellectual Culture** (9 minutes):
- Zhu Xi's orthodoxy integral to Ming system, all had to study Four Books and Zhu Xi's interpretations
- Because poetry dropped (Zhu Xi thought it had no moral value), candidates didn't lose poetry love
- Examiners not immune to new intellectual trends
- **Wang Yangming (1472-1529)** most important intellectual movement challenge
- Failed jinshi twice, passed 1499, fell afoul of eunuch dictator Liu Jin 1504
- Arrested, beaten, assigned banishment post in aboriginal Guizhou
- There had spiritual/intellectual breakthrough
- Universal principles in every person's mind, clearing obstructions allows knowledge to surface
- "Extension of knowledge" means investigation of things (Zhu Xi) BUT Wang: gaining understanding through clearing the mind
- **Moral action results spontaneously from true understanding** (thought and action NOT separate)
- Attracted many followers, movement remained strong through end of dynasty
- 1527: Called out of retirement, successful military campaigns, health failed, died on way home 1529
- Within decades, judgment reversed, 1584 painting on Confucian temple walls

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (4 minutes):
Partner Discussion: If everyone has the same capacity to recognize right and wrong (Wang Yangming), what are the implications for social hierarchy? Why might this challenge the examination system?

### 7. **Social Dimensions** (7 minutes):
- County with 20,000 households, dozen or so family lines might account for nearly all shengyuan
- When looked at from local community perspective, families prominent for generations more striking than new men
- Educated class larger than ever before, more books written
- **Printing spread**: More books in Ming than earlier periods, more types
- Reference books, entrepreneurial book publishers commissioned artists for illustrations
- By 16th century, more books aimed at audience looking to be entertained rather than educated
- Fiction written in vernacular: **Three Kingdoms**, **Water Margin**, **Journey to the West**, **Plum in the Golden Vase**
- Drama very popular, full-length novels appeared
- Most successful playwright: **Tang Xianzu** (1598 The Peony Pavilion)

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The examination system created a nationwide culture of education and literary achievement, but it also created intense competition and frustration. Next lecture: How did the Ming Dynasty decline as internal problems and external threats mounted?

**Big Question**: Did the examination system's expansion increase social mobility, or did it primarily allow established families to maintain their dominance through education?
