# CH 4 — Lecture 2 (Revised): Ethnicity, Identity, and the Northern/Southern Divide (c. 200–580)

**Big question:** *Who counted as “Chinese” during the centuries when “China” wasn’t a single state?*  
**Thesis:** In the age of division, “Chinese-ness” wasn’t a bloodline—it was a shifting toolkit: language, law, lineage stories, dress, ritual, and (crucially) *political allegiance*. North and south built different identity strategies under different pressures.

---

## Learning objectives (student-facing)
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:
1. Explain why “Han vs. barbarian” is a *political* and *administrative* distinction as much as (or more than) an ethnic one.
2. Describe how Northern Dynasties regimes created legitimacy through hybrid institutions (steppe military + Chinese bureaucracy).
3. Compare Northern and Southern elite identity strategies (lineage, culture, state service, “refugee” status).

## Lecture roadmap (55 minutes)

### 1) Hook: “Who Counts as Chinese?” (5 min)
- **Cold open:** Put two images/phrases on screen:
  - A Northern Wei court scene in Luoyang (Tuoba/Yuan rulers in “Chinese” dress)
  - A Southern aristocratic genealogy scroll
- Ask: **If both say they are the “true heirs” of Han civilization, who’s right?**
- Introduce three identity levers used in this era:
  1) **Power** (who can tax and conscript?)  
  2) **Culture** (language, dress, ritual, education)  
  3) **Lineage** (genealogies, origin myths)

**Key framing (avoid the trap):**  
“Han” in sources can mean “people of the Central Plains,” “people registered under certain legal categories,” “people who speak certain languages,” or simply “the dynasty we claim to inherit.” It changes with context.

---

### 2) Who were the “barbarians”? (10 min)
**Problem:** The word “barbarian” makes it sound like *one thing*. It wasn’t. It was a grab‑bag label with huge variation.

- **Five ‘barbarians’ (Wu Hu 五胡) — a Chinese category, not a self-description**
  - **Xiongnu** (Huns?) — long frontier presence; some deeply integrated into Jin military politics
  - **Xianbei** — multiple confederations; the Tuoba branch becomes Northern Wei
  - **Di** and **Qiang** — highland/frontier groups in northwest China, often allies/enemies of regimes
  - **Jie** — small group in sources; most famous via Shi Le / Later Zhao (often described in strongly “othering” language by hostile texts)

**Up-to-date caution:**  
Modern historians increasingly treat many of these labels as *situational and administrative*—sometimes reflecting how a court wanted to classify people for governance, not stable “tribal nations.”

- **Mini-case:** “Hu” as a category
  - In many contexts, “Hu” can mean “people from the north/west” or “non-Han,” but also “foreign” in trade, military, and religion.
  - The same person could be “Hu” in one document and “Han” in another depending on office, marriage, or residence.

---

### 3) The Sixteen Kingdoms: an era of violence and improvisation (8 min)
**Fix the chronology up front:**  
- The **Sixteen Kingdoms** period is usually dated **304–439**, beginning with Xiongnu-led Han Zhao and ending when Northern Wei unifies the north.  
- The collapse sequence:
  - **Western Jin** collapses under internal conflict + frontier militarization
  - **311:** Han Zhao forces under **Liu Cong** sack **Luoyang** (the Disaster of Yongjia). citeturn2search6

**What to emphasize (identity angle):**
- New rulers rapidly learned: you cannot rule North China without:
  - **Chinese clerks and administrators** (paperwork empire)
  - **Tax and land systems** (or you starve your army)
  - **Ideology** (Mandate of Heaven language still matters)
- Meanwhile, “Han” elites discovered: you cannot survive without:
  - **Local patronage networks**
  - **Negotiation with new military powers**
  - **Flexible identity performance** (dress, marriage ties, service)

**Quick character vignette (optional): Shi Le**
- Former captive/outsider who becomes a major warlord and founds **Later Zhao** (319–351).  
- Use him to illustrate how sources can portray frontier figures as “uncivilized” while those same rulers employ Chinese institutions.

---

### 4) Northern vs. Southern identity pressures (5 min)
**North = conquest, churn, and mixed populations**
- Constant warfare, migration, and reclassification
- Political legitimacy requires both **steppe-style military loyalty** and **Chinese-style governance**

**South = “refugee Han” state-building**
- Southern courts (Eastern Jin → Southern dynasties) build identity around:
  - **Genealogy**, **literary culture**, **court ritual**
  - The idea that “we are the true Central Plains tradition in exile”

---

### 5) Northern Wei: a different approach to legitimacy (12 min)
**Northern Wei basics:** Tuoba Xianbei regime (386–534) that unifies the north in **439**.

**Early Northern Wei strategy (Pingcheng / Datong era):**
- Run a **hybrid state**:
  - Steppe military organization and elite networks
  - Chinese bureaucratic practices and taxation
- Courts rely on Chinese advisors—but political/military power remains concentrated in Tuoba/Xianbei circles.

**The Xiaowen turn (the Luoyang move)**
- **494:** capital moved from **Pingcheng (Datong)** to **Luoyang**. citeturn2search0turn2search4
- Court-driven reforms associated with “sinicization”:
  - Promotion of “Chinese” dress and language at court
  - Surname reforms (Tuoba → Yuan; elite name changes) and encouragement of intermarriage citeturn2search0turn2search4

**Update from recent scholarship (how to teach it now):**
- Don’t frame this as “they became Chinese,” full stop.
- Frame it as **state centralization** and **elite competition**:
  - Luoyang reforms strengthened a bureaucratic center and reoriented court culture,
  - while also producing backlash among frontier military elites.

**Policy example you already have (keep, but sharpen): Equal-field system**
- **Equal-field (juntian) in Northern Wei** is a state attempt to stabilize taxation and labor by tying people to land and registers.
- Identity is embedded in administration: “who you are” becomes “where you’re registered, what obligations you owe, and which households count.”

---

### 6) “Sinicization” as politics (6 min)
**Teach the historiography explicitly (students love this):**
- Older narrative: “Northern conquerors adopted Chinese civilization.”
- Newer narrative: the northern states were building a **new form of empire**—multiethnic, hybrid, and pragmatically ideological.  
  - Scott Pearce’s monograph is a flagship statement of this approach. citeturn6search1
- A useful soundbite: “The reforms weren’t a cultural makeover—they were a governing strategy.”

---

### 7) The hybrid reality: border generals and mixed households (8 min)
**Core point:** Many northern elites were neither “pure steppe” nor “pure Han”—they were *border people*.

- **Gao Huan (d. 547)** as a type:
  - A successful warlord in the east (Eastern Wei sphere) who could speak to both “old steppe” and “new bureaucratic” constituencies.
- **Hybrid households**:
  - Intermarriage
  - Bilingualism and code-switching
  - Adoption of “Han” genealogies by non-Han elites (and the reverse: Han elites taking steppe military roles)

**Optional “science-y” add-on (keeps you up to date):**
- New bioarchaeological work (e.g., isotopic studies) increasingly shows *diverse lifeways* and diets in northern metropolitan zones—supporting the “mixed society” picture. citeturn6search14

---

### 8) The southern perspective: refugees and aristocrats (5 min)
**Eastern Jin (317–420) and successors**
- Southern courts portray themselves as:
  - The “real” continuation of Han/Wei/Jin tradition
  - Guardians of elite culture (poetry, calligraphy, ritual)
- **Refugee identity as status**
  - Northern émigré lineages gain prestige through claims of “lost homeland”
  - Genealogies become political weapons (who is “properly” elite?)

**Keep your nice punchline:**  
In the south, being “Chinese” is often framed as **culture + pedigree**. In the north, it’s **power + registration + military loyalty**.

---

### 9) Toward reunification: institutions that outlive the divide (4 min)
Even without unity, key institutions and habits spread:
- More **standardized land/tax policy experiments** (equal-field variants)
- More **professionalized northern militaries** (culminating in Western Wei / Northern Zhou innovations)
- The increasingly plausible idea that a single ruler could reunify the realm—because both north and south still speak the language of empire.

---

### 10) Closing: what students should remember (2 min)
- “Han vs. barbarian” is not a stable biological map; it’s a **political/administrative language**.
- Northern regimes invented durable solutions by mixing steppe and Chinese statecraft.
- Southern elites defended identity through culture and genealogy—while also adapting to exile.

## Brief lecture notes (talking points, with transitions)

**0:00–5:00**  
“I want you to imagine you’re a bureaucrat with a registry book. Someone walks in: they speak a northern accent, wear Chinese robes, have a Xianbei grandfather, and claim descent from the Han imperial clan. Do you write ‘Han’ or ‘Hu’? This lecture is about why that question mattered—and why it had no stable answer.”

**5:00–15:00**  
Define Wu Hu as a Chinese label. Stress mixed frontier zones and long-term contact. “Barbarian” is often a slur in sources; treat it as evidence of political anxiety.

**15:00–23:00**  
Sixteen Kingdoms chaos. Emphasize: *institutions travel*. Even conqueror states need clerks, tax systems, ritual legitimacy. Mention 311 Luoyang sack as a trauma marker. citeturn2search6

**23:00–40:00**  
Northern Wei as your anchor example. Explain the Pingcheng phase as hybrid governance. Then the Luoyang turn as a centralizing project: move capital (494), court reforms, surname policies, intermarriage. citeturn2search0turn2search4  
Pivot: “Sinicization” is a *governing strategy*, not a one-way cultural conversion. citeturn6search1turn6search16

**40:00–48:00**  
Hybrid reality. Border elites and mixed households; identity as performance + paperwork. Optional isotopes to show archaeology backing the “mixed society” model. citeturn6search14

**48:00–55:00**  
South as the “culture-and-lineage” solution; north as “registration-and-military.” Wrap with the idea that both are claiming *the same empire*—just through different identity technologies.

## Suggested readings (instructor prep) — brief annotated bibliography

### Core syntheses (start here)
1. **Albert E. Dien & Keith N. Knapp (eds.), *The Cambridge History of China, Volume 2: The Six Dynasties, 220–589* (Cambridge, 2019).**  
   The current heavyweight reference: chronology, politics, society, religion. Use it to sanity-check dates and to grab reliable framing for north/south structures. citeturn1view0

2. **Mark Edward Lewis, *China Between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties* (Harvard, 2009).**  
   Still the best single-volume narrative synthesis for teaching: institutions, elite culture, and the long arc toward Sui reunification.

### Northern Wei and “sinicization” rethought
3. **Scott Pearce, *Northern Wei (386–534): A New Form of Empire in East Asia* (Oxford, 2023).**  
   The most up-to-date monograph-length statement that treats Northern Wei as an innovative early empire, not a failed “barbarian” imitation of Han. citeturn6search1

4. **J. Chen, “State-Building with Elite Compensation in Early Medieval China” (working paper / PDF circulating online, 2022).**  
   Useful for the *mechanics* of how Northern Wei integrated elites and why reforms mattered administratively; also provides a compact explanation of the “sinicization narrative” as a modern framing problem. citeturn6search16

### Identity, ethnicity, and the north–south divide
5. **Andrew Chittick, *The Jiankang Empire in Chinese and World History* (Oxford, 2020).**  
   Excellent for the southern story: Jiankang as a political and cultural project, and how “exile” identity became a state ideology.

6. **Chin-Yin Tseng, *The Making of the Tuoba Northern Wei…* (Oxford DPhil thesis, 2012).**  
   For material culture and the Pingcheng period: great if you want concrete examples of “dual presence” (steppe + Chinese) that students can *see*. citeturn6search5

### Institutions that matter for your next lecture arc (bridge to reunification)
7. **ChinaKnowledge entry on the *fubing* system (府兵)** (reference overview).  
   Not a substitute for monographs, but a clear orientation: *fubing* is associated with Western Wei/Northern Zhou reforms under Yuwen Tai and matters for the Sui/Tang military state. citeturn0search6

### Primary sources (for quotes / framing)
- **Wei shu (Book of Wei)** — Northern Wei court perspective.
- **Jin shu (Book of Jin)** — elite memory of Jin collapse.
- **Zizhi tongjian** (Sima Guang) — later synthesis; excellent for narrative, but always “read for bias.”

## Quick “missing pieces” you may want to add (optional slide-sized inserts)
- A map slide that shows **Pingcheng → Luoyang** shift as *geopolitical* (frontier defense vs. central legitimacy). citeturn2search4
- A 90-second “terminology hygiene” slide: **Han / Hu / Zhongguo / Hua-Xia** as context-dependent labels.
- A one-slide bridge to Buddhism (next lecture): why frontier trade + mixed courts make Buddhism politically useful.

## North–South snapshot (slide-ready)
| Northern Dynasties | Southern Dynasties |
|---|---|
| Multiethnic military and political elites | “Refugee” aristocracy claiming cultural continuity |
| Hybrid court culture (steppe + classical Chinese) | “Pure” Chinese culture claimed (ritual, poetry, pedigree) |
| Often more territorially consolidated at a given moment | More frequent dynastic turnover |
| Buddhist–Confucian–Daoist mix | Buddhist flourishing + aristocratic culture |

**Teaching notes:**
- Present the “southern purity” claim as a *political strategy*, not a simple fact.
- The north is not “less Chinese”; it is building a different kind of empire.

**Summative (short answer or exam):**
1. Explain Xiaowen’s Luoyang move and reforms. What problems were they solving, and what resistance did they create? citeturn8search0turn6search16  
2. Compare how the Northern dynasties and the Southern dynasties constructed legitimacy and identity.
3. Document analysis: Use Gao Huan’s speech (or a Yongjia excerpt) to show how leaders managed divided societies.
