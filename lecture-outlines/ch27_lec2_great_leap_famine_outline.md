## The Great Leap Forward and Its Catastrophe (1958-1962)

**Total Lecture Time:** 50 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain Mao's rationale for the Great Leap Forward and how it departed from Soviet-style development
2. Analyze how the commune system transformed rural life and why it led to agricultural collapse
3. Evaluate the causes and scale of the Great Leap Famine, including the role of political terror in preventing accurate reporting
4. Assess responsibility for the famine and explain why the Communist Party did not fall despite the catastrophe

---

### Lecture Theme

The Great Leap Forward (1958-1961) was Mao's attempt to transform China from a poor agricultural country into a communist utopia through sheer human will. Instead, it produced humanity's worst famine, killing an estimated 30-45 million people. This lecture examines how utopian ideology, combined with a political system that punished truth-telling, created a catastrophe on an almost unimaginable scale—and how the party survived it.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow the Great Leap from the perspective of both the powerful and the powerless: Mao's increasingly delusional confidence that human willpower could overcome any obstacle, local cadres caught between impossible grain quotas and starving villagers, and peasants who watched their families die while granaries stood full of grain destined for export. The famine reveals what happens when an entire political system loses contact with reality.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Recovering the Famine:** For decades, the Great Leap Famine was officially unacknowledged in China. Western scholars estimated excess deaths in the millions but lacked reliable data. Only with the opening of local archives in the 1980s and 1990s did the famine's true scale become clear. Yang Jisheng, a senior Chinese journalist whose father died in the famine, spent years compiling local records for his book *Tombstone* (2008), which documented approximately 36 million excess deaths. Frank Dikötter's *Mao's Great Famine* (2010) used provincial archives to argue for 45 million. We'll examine what caused this catastrophe and why it remained hidden for so long.

## OPENING: The Backyard Furnaces (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display photograph of peasants gathered around makeshift furnaces

Begin with an image that captures the Great Leap's combination of enthusiasm and absurdity:

In the fall of 1958, across China, peasants were melting down their cooking pots, farm tools, and door hinges in crude "backyard furnaces" to produce steel.

They worked day and night. They burned their furniture and their houses' wooden beams for fuel. They met their quotas.

And the "steel" they produced? Mostly useless slag—too impure for any purpose.

**Opening Question:** "What kind of political system produces a campaign where millions of people work themselves to exhaustion to produce something worthless? How does this happen?"

[Allow brief student responses]

**The Answer:**
This wasn't mass insanity. It was the logical outcome of a system where:
- Impossible targets came from above
- Reporting failure meant political destruction
- Everyone knew the truth but no one could say it
- Enthusiasm for the leader had become mandatory

**Transition:** Today we examine the Great Leap Forward—Mao's attempt to vault China into communism through willpower alone. The result was the greatest famine in human history, one that remained largely hidden for decades.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Vision—Surpassing Britain in Fifteen Years (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Mao's Frustration:**
By 1957, Mao had grown impatient. The Soviet development model was producing results, but too slowly. At this rate, it would take decades for China to catch up with the West.

After the Anti-Rightist Campaign silenced his critics, Mao felt free to pursue a more radical path.

**The Great Leap Vision:**
Mao announced that China would "surpass Britain in fifteen years" in steel production. But the Great Leap was about more than steel—it was about transforming human nature itself.

Mao believed that:
- Human will could overcome material obstacles
- Mass mobilization could substitute for technology and capital
- China could skip the stages of development that other countries had passed through
- Communism—the elimination of private property, inequality, even money—could be achieved immediately

**[Click slide: Great Leap Forward propaganda poster—radiant future]**

**Departing from the Soviet Model:**
The Great Leap rejected Soviet-style central planning:
- Instead of expertise, it emphasized "Red over expert"—political enthusiasm over technical knowledge
- Instead of heavy industry concentrated in cities, it dispersed production to the countryside
- Instead of material incentives, it relied on revolutionary spirit
- Instead of gradual development, it promised transformation overnight

Khrushchev thought Mao had gone mad. The Sino-Soviet split accelerated.

**The Commune System:**
In 1958, China's 740,000 collective farms were merged into about 26,000 giant People's Communes, each containing thousands of households.

Communes were supposed to:
- Pool all labor and resources
- Abolish private plots and private cooking
- Provide free food in communal dining halls
- Organize peasants into military-style brigades
- Produce everything from steel to grain to consumer goods

**The Mania:**
The Great Leap unfolded in an atmosphere of frenzied enthusiasm:
- Villages competed to report the highest yields
- "Sputnik fields" supposedly produced impossible harvests—10,000, 50,000, even 100,000 pounds of grain per acre
- Newspapers published photographs of children standing on top of wheat supposedly so dense it could support their weight
- Those who expressed doubt were labeled rightists

### Segment 2: The Reality—Famine (15 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 17 minutes into class]**

**Content Warning:**
What follows describes mass starvation and its effects. This material is essential to understanding twentieth-century history but is deeply disturbing.

**How It Began:**
The famine resulted from multiple converging failures:

**1. False Reporting:**
Local cadres, terrified of being labeled rightists, reported impossible harvests. If your neighbor claimed to produce 10,000 pounds per acre, you had to claim more. The lies accumulated upward until leadership believed China had more grain than it could possibly use.

**2. Procurement Quotas:**
The state set grain procurement quotas based on reported (fictional) yields. Cadres had to deliver grain that didn't exist. They took seed grain. They took everything.

**3. Communal Dining Halls:**
Peasants were forbidden to cook at home. Communal dining halls served food based on work points—and controlled how much anyone could eat. When the food ran out, there was no backup.

**4. Labor Mobilization:**
Peasants were pulled from fields to work on steel production, irrigation projects, and other campaigns. Crops rotted unharvested.

**5. Rejection of Expertise:**
Mao endorsed pseudo-scientific farming techniques: deep plowing that destroyed soil structure, close planting that stunted crops, campaigns against sparrows that led to insect plagues.

**[Click slide: "Backyard furnace" photograph]**

**The Famine Unfolds:**
By late 1959, people were dying. The famine peaked in 1960 and continued into 1961.

**The Scale:**
Recent scholarship estimates:
- Total excess deaths: 30-45 million people
- The worst-affected provinces: Sichuan, Henan, Anhui, Gansu, Qinghai
- In some villages, 30-50 percent of the population died
- The death rate was worst in grain-producing areas—they had the highest quotas to meet

**Table: Deaths in Hard-Hit Provinces, 1957 and 1960:**

| Province | 1957 Deaths | 1960 Deaths | Percent Change |
|----------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| Anhui    | 250,000     | 2,200,000   | +780%          |
| Gansu    | 142,041     | 538,479     | +279%          |
| Guangxi  | 261,785     | 644,700     | +146%          |
| Henan    | 572,000     | 1,908,000   | +233%          |
| Hunan    | 370,059     | 1,068,118   | +189%          |

**Human Experience:**
Survivors' accounts describe:
- Eating bark, grass, dirt, and leather
- Widespread edema (swelling from malnutrition)
- Families splitting up to search for food
- Parents watching children starve
- Corpses unburied because the living were too weak
- Isolated but documented cases of cannibalism

A survivor recalled: "We ate everything—leaves, roots, even the thatching from our roof. My grandmother just lay down one day and didn't get up. We were too weak to bury her properly."

**The Political Factor:**
The famine was not simply a natural disaster. China continued to export grain throughout the worst years—to repay Soviet loans and maintain the fiction of abundance. Granaries held grain while people starved nearby.

**Why Didn't Anyone Stop It?**
The Anti-Rightist Campaign had taught officials that reporting bad news was dangerous. Those who questioned the Great Leap were purged. Even Defense Minister Peng Dehuai, who privately criticized Mao's policies at the 1959 Lushan Conference, was denounced and removed from power.

Mao received reports of "local difficulties" but either disbelieved them or blamed local cadres. The political system had lost the capacity to correct itself.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "The famine killed tens of millions of people while grain was being exported and cadres reported record harvests. How do political systems reach a point where no one can tell the truth? What might break such a pattern?"

[Allow brief pair discussion]

**Key insight:** The Anti-Rightist Campaign created a system where honesty was punished. Once that pattern was established, accurate information could not flow upward.

---

### Segment 3: The Reckoning—and Its Limits (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 35 minutes into class]**

**Retreat from the Great Leap:**
By 1960-1961, even Mao could not deny the crisis. The Great Leap was quietly abandoned:
- Communes were reorganized into smaller units
- Private plots were restored
- Communal dining halls closed
- Material incentives returned

**The Seven Thousand Cadres Conference (1962):**
At a major party meeting in January 1962, leaders acknowledged "serious mistakes." Liu Shaoqi, the president, reportedly said that the famine was "30 percent natural disaster, 70 percent human error."

**[Click slide: Liu Shaoqi photograph]**

Mao offered a self-criticism but shifted blame to local cadres. He stepped back from day-to-day governance, letting Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping manage recovery.

**But No Real Accountability:**
- No one was prosecuted for the famine
- Mao remained paramount leader
- The party did not permit public discussion of what had happened
- Official statistics were falsified to minimize the death toll
- For decades, the famine was unmentionable in China

**Why Didn't the Party Fall?**
How did the Communist Party survive presiding over humanity's worst famine?

Several factors:
1. **Information control:** Most Chinese didn't know the famine's full scope; it was experienced as local disaster, not national catastrophe
2. **Recovery:** Pragmatic policies after 1962 brought rapid improvement
3. **No alternative:** There was no political opposition, no free press, no way to organize dissent
4. **Nationalist legitimacy:** The party still claimed credit for unifying China and resisting imperialism
5. **Selective memory:** Those who suffered most were peasants with no voice; urban populations were relatively protected

**The Seeds of the Cultural Revolution:**
Mao brooded on his setback. He blamed the famine's aftermath not on his own policies but on revisionist tendencies within the party—on those like Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping who had retreated from socialist goals.

In Mao's mind, the lesson of the Great Leap was not that his policies had failed. It was that the party needed to be purified—that "capitalist roaders" had sabotaged the revolution.

This analysis would lead, within a few years, to the Cultural Revolution.

### Segment 4: The Sino-Soviet Split (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 45 minutes into class]**

**Growing Apart:**
The Great Leap accelerated tensions between China and the Soviet Union that had been building since the mid-1950s:

**Ideological Differences:**
- Mao rejected Khrushchev's "peaceful coexistence" with the West
- China criticized Soviet "revisionism"—abandonment of revolutionary principles
- The Soviets thought Mao was reckless and dogmatic

**National Interests:**
- The Soviets refused to share nuclear weapons technology
- China resented Soviet dominance of the international communist movement
- Border disputes added territorial dimension to ideological conflict

**The Break:**
In 1960, the Soviet Union abruptly withdrew all its advisers from China, taking blueprints and plans with them. Half-finished factories stood empty.

By 1963, the two communist giants were publicly denouncing each other. China called the Soviets "social imperialists"; the Soviets called Mao a megalomaniac.

**Consequences:**
The Sino-Soviet Split:
- Left China diplomatically isolated
- Ended hope of Soviet assistance for development
- Created a three-way Cold War (U.S., USSR, China)
- Eventually pushed China toward rapprochement with the United States
- Confirmed Mao's belief that China must follow its own path

**Nuclear Development:**
Despite the split, China developed its own nuclear weapons, testing its first atomic bomb in 1964. Mao had said he didn't fear nuclear war—even if half of humanity died, the other half would build socialism on the ruins.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 53 minutes into class]**

**Quick Reflection:** "Mao interpreted the Great Leap's failure not as evidence that his policies were wrong, but as evidence that the party had betrayed his vision. What does this suggest about his psychology? About the political system?"

[Students reflect briefly]

**Foreshadowing:** Mao's conviction that enemies within the party had sabotaged the revolution would lead to his next—and in some ways most destructive—campaign: the Cultural Revolution.

## CLOSING: The Famine's Shadow (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
The Great Leap Forward was:
- The most ambitious attempt to transform society through willpower in human history
- The greatest famine in human history
- A catastrophe made possible by a political system that punished truth-telling
- A trauma that remained officially unacknowledged for decades

**The Lessons:**
What the Great Leap reveals:
- Ideology can override evidence when dissent is forbidden
- Bureaucratic systems can produce outcomes no individual intends
- Catastrophes can be hidden even from those causing them
- Political systems can survive disasters that would topple others

**Looking Forward:**
The party retreated from the Great Leap but did not reform. Mao remained in power, convinced that revisionist enemies had sabotaged his revolution.

Within a few years, he would launch a new campaign—one that targeted not peasants or landlords but the Communist Party itself. The Cultural Revolution would consume a generation.

Next time: The Cultural Revolution and its legacy.

**Final Thought:**
In 2008, journalist Yang Jisheng published *Tombstone*, his monumental history of the famine. The title had double meaning: a tombstone for his father, who starved to death in 1959; and a tombstone for the system that caused the famine.

The book remains banned in mainland China.
