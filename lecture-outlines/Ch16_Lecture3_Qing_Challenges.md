# LECTURE 3: Qing China Faces New Challenges

**50 minutes | Focus: What internal and external challenges confronted Qing China in the late 18th century, and how successfully did the dynasty respond?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
In 1793, Lord Macartney led a British embassy to China with gifts including clocks, telescopes, and weapons. The Qianlong Emperor wrote to King George III: "We have never valued ingenious articles, nor do we have the slightest need of your country's manufactures." Within 50 years, Britain would defeat China in the Opium War. What happened?

### 2. **Population Pressure and Social Strain** (11 minutes):
- **Dramatic population growth**: ~140 million (1700) to ~300 million (1800) to ~430 million (1850)
- **New World crops** enabled growth:
  - Sweet potatoes, maize, peanuts grew on marginal land
  - Could be cultivated on hillsides, sandy soil where rice wouldn't grow
  - Facilitated expansion into previously uncultivated areas
- **But growth created problems**:
  - Amount of land per capita decreased
  - Many families survived on smaller plots
  - Increased pressure on resources
  - More landless laborers
  - Migration to cities, frontier regions
- **Social stratification increased**:
  - Rich got richer, poor got poorer
  - Lineages in Guangdong and Fujian dominated local society
  - Powerful lineages controlled land, commerce, often avoided taxes
  - Weaker families squeezed
  - **Tenancy became more common**
- **Local society organization**:
  - Lineages sponsored schools, temples, charitable activities
  - Lineage leaders sometimes more powerful than government officials
  - Community compacts promoted mutual moral improvement
  - But also could be exclusionary, discriminatory
- **Dream of Red Mansions** (18th century novel):
  - Depicts decline of aristocratic family
  - Complex portrait of women's lives
  - Domestic tensions, tragic love story
  - Allegory of Qing Dynasty itself?

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: When population doubles but agricultural land doesn't, what happens to society? Think about land prices, wages, migration, and social tensions.

### 4. **Government Challenges and Corruption** (11 minutes):
- **Bureaucracy struggled to keep pace** with population growth and territorial expansion
- County magistrate in 1800 governed more people than in 1700
- Same number of officials for much larger population
- **Reliance on local elites increased**:
  - Magistrates couldn't govern without cooperation of local leaders
  - Lineage heads, degree holders, wealthy landowners
  - Created opportunities for corruption, favoritism
- **Heshen corruption scandal** revealed deep problems:
  - Qianlong's favorite from 1770s until emperor's death (1799)
  - Systematically embezzled funds
  - Built network of corrupt officials
  - Amassed fortune ~1.1 billion taels (equivalent to decade of government revenue)
  - New emperor had him arrested, executed (1799)
  - But problem went deeper than one individual
- **White Lotus Rebellion (1796-1804)**:
  - Religious sect with millenarian beliefs
  - Drew support from displaced migrants, poor farmers
  - Spread across several provinces
  - Government took 8 years to suppress
  - Cost enormous amount (more than fighting Mongols)
  - Revealed military weakness: Banner armies had deteriorated
  - **Had to rely on local militia** organized by gentry
- **Mid-Qing "conservative turn"**:
  - After Heshen scandal and White Lotus Rebellion
  - Officials emphasized moral reform, frugality
  - Tried to return to idealized past
  - But population growth and commercialization irreversible

### 5. **Maritime Trade and European Contact** (11 minutes):
- **Ming had tried to control maritime trade**: Restricted to few ports, unsuccessful
- **Qing more pragmatic**: Allowed trade but channeled it through system
- **Canton (Guangzhou) system from 1757**:
  - All European trade had to go through Canton
  - Chinese merchants organized into **Cohong** guild
  - Guild had monopoly on foreign trade
  - Foreign merchants could only deal with Cohong
  - Foreigners restricted to small area outside city walls
  - Could only be in Canton during trading season
  - Wives had to stay in Macao
  - System worked for China: collected taxes, limited foreign influence
- **European demand for Chinese goods**:
  - Tea, silk, porcelain highly valued
  - But Europeans had little China wanted
  - **Trade imbalance**: Silver flowed into China
  - By early 19th century, Britain importing huge amounts of tea
  - Had to pay in silver
- **British East India Company began importing opium from India**:
  - Grown in Bengal, shipped to China
  - Demand grew rapidly
  - Reversed trade imbalance
  - By 1830s, silver flowing OUT of China
  - Opium addiction became social problem
  - Qing government tried to ban opium, ineffectively
- **Macartney Embassy (1793)**:
  - British sought diplomatic relations, expanded trade rights
  - Qianlong refused to receive Macartney as equal
  - Insisted on kowtow (full prostration)
  - Macartney refused (or compromised)
  - **Qianlong's letter to King George III**: "We have never valued ingenious articles"
  - Rejected British requests
  - Tributary system framework couldn't accommodate European diplomacy

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: The Qianlong Emperor saw no need for European goods or ideas. With hindsight, was this a mistake? What might China have gained or lost by engaging differently with Europeans?

### 7. **Cultural Vibrancy Amid Challenges** (6 minutes):
- Despite political and social problems, **18th-century culture flourished**:
- **Evidential scholarship (kaozheng)**: Rigorous textual analysis
  - Scholars questioned authenticity of ancient texts
  - Used philological methods to recover original meanings
  - More empirical, less metaphysical than Song Neo-Confucianism
- **Dream of Red Mansions** (Cao Xueqin, mid-18th century):
  - China's greatest novel
  - Semi-autobiographical
  - Depicts decline of aristocratic family
  - Complex psychological portraits
  - Over 400 characters
  - Layers of allegory, symbolism
- **Poetry continued to flourish**
- **Painting**: Individualist painters rejected orthodox styles
- **Gardens of Suzhou**: Sophisticated aesthetic achievements
- **Popular culture**: Operas, storytelling, folk religions
- **But conservative turn** in official culture:
  - After mid-18th century, less openness to new ideas
  - Evidential scholarship acceptable (non-threatening)
  - But philosophical innovation discouraged
  - Literary inquisition: Qianlong had works searched for anti-Manchu content

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
By 1800, the Qing Empire appeared stable and prosperous, but population pressure, government corruption, and encounters with aggressive European powers would soon create unprecedented challenges. The 19th century would test whether the traditional Chinese political and cultural system could adapt to a changing world.

**Big Question**: Was the Qing "conservative turn" in the late 18th century a prudent response to overextension, or a failure to recognize the need for adaptation to new realities?
