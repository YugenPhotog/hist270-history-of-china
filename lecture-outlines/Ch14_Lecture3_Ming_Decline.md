# LECTURE 3: Ming Decline and Fall

**50 minutes | Focus: What combination of internal weaknesses and external pressures brought down the Ming Dynasty?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
In 1627, army deserters and bandits began forming gangs in northern China. By 1632, they were scouring the countryside in search of food. By 1644, Li Zicheng captured Beijing, and the last Ming emperor hanged himself. What went wrong?

### 2. **Eunuch Power Returns** (10 minutes):
- Eunuchs became serious problem in Ming (as in late Han and late Tang)
- **Palace eunuchs** given responsibility for palace army (counter to regional commanders)
- Soon became as troublesome as regional commanders
- Emperor had to ally with eunuch faction or official faction to have any hope of influencing policy
- After 820, factions of officials and eunuchs plotted to enthrone, manipulate, or murder emperors
- 835: Emperor plotted with officials to purge eunuchs; when plan discovered, eunuchs ordered slaughter of 1,000+ officials
- **Ming pattern similar**:
  - Early 9th century: eunuch-dominated court affairs
  - 1380: Taizu abolished chancellor position
  - Cabinet of grand secretaries (similar role), but eunuchs managed flow of paperwork
  - Eunuchs could influence policy by adding stigma to memorials
- **Eunuch political involvement**:
  - Ming court created palace eunuch army
  - Secret service prison run by eunuchs given responsibility to investigate corruption and sedition
  - By 1590s: thousands had been flogged in open court
  - Some emperors dealt directly with eunuch department heads

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: Why did emperors keep turning to eunuchs despite the obvious problems this created? What does this reveal about palace politics?

### 4. **Fiscal and Military Crisis** (12 minutes):
- After 1600: Ming government beset by fiscal, military, and political problems
- Government nearly bankrupt
- Spent heavily to help defend Korea against Japanese invasion (Chapters 13 and 15)
- Had to support ever-increasing imperial clan (princes and descendants on stipends)
- Series of natural disasters
- **"Little ice age"**: Drop in average temperatures, shortened growing season, reduced harvests
- 1627-1628: Food shortages critical in northern Shaanxi
- Army deserters, laid-off soldiers began forming gangs
- Gangs smuggled illicit salt, ambushed merchants and tax convoys, rampaged through countryside
- By 1632: Stolen all their grain, hard-pressed farmers joined just to survive
- Li Zicheng (former postal relay worker, became paramount rebel leader in north)
- Zhang Xianzhang (ex-soldier) main leader in region between Yellow and Yangzi rivers
- Ming government had little choice but to try to increase taxes (last thing people needed)
- Heavier exactions, floods, droughts, locusts, epidemics ravaged one region after another

### 5. **Regional Uprisings and Collapse** (9 minutes):
- In Jiangnan area: tenants rose up against landlords, urban workers rioted
- Meanwhile, two main rebel leaders in race to topple Ming and establish new dynasty
- Li and Zhang announced founding of new dynasties, appointed officials, minted coins
- Neither succeeded in pacifying sizable region or ending looting and violence
- 1642: Li cut dikes on Yellow River; slaughter of Chinese residents, flooding
- Two months later, Li moved through Hebei into Beijing
- Last Ming emperor Chongqing (r. 1628-1644), in despair, took his own life
- Zhang moved in opposite direction into Sichuan, attacks on Chongqing and Chengdu involved widespread slaughter
- Both Li and Zhang announced new dynasties
- Neither could succeed in pacifying region or ending looting

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Partner Discussion: Compare the Ming collapse to the Tang collapse. What patterns do you see? Are there common factors that weaken Chinese dynasties?

### 7. **External Threats and Cultural Vitality** (7 minutes):
- Beyond internal problems, Ming faced external threats
- **Mongols** remained formidable on northern border (though never united)
- Repeatedly raided, in 1449 captured Ming emperor Zhengtong
- In 1550, besieged Beijing itself
- **Great Wall**: Ming built walls we see today (extending/connecting earlier walls)
- Maritime piracy major problem along coasts (Chapter 13)
- Ming tried to limit maritime trade to few coastal cities
- Policy proved of no use, abandoned in late 16th century
- **Despite political problems**, Ming saw remarkable cultural vitality:
  - Full-length novels in vernacular
  - Drama flourished (scripts widely read)
  - Painting and calligraphy highly valued
  - Gardens of Suzhou famous for sophisticated beauty
  - Educated class larger than ever
  - More books written and published
  - Fiction, drama, plays accessible even to rudimentary educated

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Ming Dynasty fell due to a perfect storm: incompetent emperors, eunuch interference, fiscal crisis, natural disasters, and peasant rebellions. But as we'll see in Chapter 16, it wasn't Chinese rebels who would rule China next—it was the Manchus from the northeast.

**Big Question**: Could the Ming Dynasty have been saved? What reforms might have prevented the collapse, and why weren't they implemented?
