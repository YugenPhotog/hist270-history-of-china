**Total Lecture Time:** 50 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain the causes and course of Japanese aggression in China from Manchuria (1931) through full-scale invasion (1937)
2. Analyze the human cost of Japanese occupation, including the Nanjing Massacre and other atrocities
3. Evaluate how the war differently affected the Nationalist government and the Communist movement
4. Assess the significance of the war years in determining the eventual outcome of the Chinese Civil War

---

### Lecture Theme

The eight years of war against Japan (1937-1945) transformed China more profoundly than any event since the 1911 Revolution. The Nationalist government was driven from its coastal strongholds into the interior, losing its industrial base and bleeding its best troops. The Communist Party, by contrast, expanded from a marginal guerrilla force into a mass movement controlling vast base areas behind Japanese lines. This lecture examines how the crucible of war forged the conditions for Communist victory.

### Central Story

We'll follow China's wartime experience through multiple perspectives: the horror of the Nanjing Massacre as witnessed by foreign nationals who stayed behind, the desperate retreat up the Yangzi to Chongqing, and life in the Communist base areas where peasants encountered a new kind of political mobilization. The war years were China's darkest hour—but also, paradoxically, the incubator of its revolutionary future.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Reevaluating the War:** For decades, Western histories of World War II marginalized China's role. Chinese suffered more casualties than any nation except the Soviet Union, and Chinese resistance tied down a million Japanese troops throughout the war. Recent scholarship by Rana Mitter (*Forgotten Ally*) and others has recovered China's central place in the global conflict. Within China, the war's interpretation remains politically sensitive: the Communist Party claims credit for resistance while minimizing Nationalist contributions, while Taiwan's official history does the reverse. We'll examine the war as both national catastrophe and political turning point.

## OPENING: A City Abandoned (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display the famous photograph of the crying baby at Shanghai South Railway Station (1937)

Begin with one of the most iconic images of the twentieth century—a wounded Chinese baby sitting alone amid the rubble of Shanghai's bombed South Railway Station, August 1937.

**Context:**
This photograph, published worldwide, brought China's war to global attention. Japanese planes had bombed the crowded station, killing hundreds of civilians. The baby's mother was dead, killed in the attack.

**Opening Question:** "This image was seen by millions of people around the world in 1937. Why do you think it didn't lead to international intervention to stop Japan?"

[Allow brief responses]

**The Bitter Answer:**
The international community condemned Japan but did little else. The League of Nations issued reports. The United States expressed disapproval. But no power was willing to confront Japan militarily. China would fight essentially alone for four years—until Pearl Harbor brought America into the war.

**Transition:** Today we examine the war that killed somewhere between 15 and 20 million Chinese people, destroyed the Nationalist government's base of power, and—paradoxically—gave the Communist Party its opportunity to grow into a force capable of challenging for national power.

**Preview:** We'll trace Japanese aggression from Manchuria through full-scale invasion, examine the horror of occupation through the Nanjing Massacre, and analyze how the war transformed both the Nationalist government and the Communist movement.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Road to War (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Japanese Expansion:**
Japan's aggression in China didn't begin in 1937. Understanding the war requires stepping back.

**Manchuria (1931):**
On September 18, 1931, Japanese officers staged an explosion on the Japanese-owned South Manchurian Railway and blamed it on Chinese saboteurs. Using this pretext, the Japanese Army occupied all of Manchuria within months—an area larger than France and Germany combined.

The conquest was virtually unopposed. Chiang Kaishek, focused on destroying the Communists, ordered his forces not to resist. "The Japanese are a disease of the skin," he reportedly said. "The Communists are a disease of the heart."

**[Click slide: Map showing Japanese-controlled Manchuria]**

Japan established the puppet state of "Manchukuo," installing the last Qing emperor, Puyi, as nominal head of state.

**The Twenty-One Demands Shadow:**
Japan's aggression in China followed a pattern established with the Twenty-One Demands of 1915. Japanese militarists believed China's resources—coal, iron, agricultural products—were essential for Japan's industrial economy and military power. They saw China as a natural sphere of Japanese influence.

**Growing Tensions (1931-1937):**
After Manchuria, Japan steadily expanded its presence in north China:
- Japanese troops occupied areas around Beijing and Tianjin
- Japanese-sponsored smuggling undermined Chinese customs revenue
- Japanese advisers promoted "autonomy" movements to detach north China from Nanjing's control

**The Xi'an Incident (1936):**
The most dramatic episode came in December 1936. Chiang Kaishek flew to Xi'an to pressure his subordinate, the "Young Marshal" Zhang Xueliang, to continue fighting the Communists rather than the Japanese. Instead, Zhang kidnapped Chiang and demanded he form a united front against Japan.

After tense negotiations—with Communist representatives participating—Chiang agreed to stop the anti-Communist campaigns and cooperate against Japan. He was released on Christmas Day.

**[Instructor note: The Xi'an Incident is one of Chinese history's great "what ifs." Had Chiang been killed, the war and revolution might have taken very different courses.]**

**The Marco Polo Bridge Incident (July 7, 1937):**
On July 7, 1937, Japanese and Chinese troops exchanged fire at Marco Polo Bridge (Lugouqiao) near Beijing. Within weeks, fighting had escalated into full-scale war.

Whether by plan or accident, Japan's military leadership decided this was the moment to subdue China once and for all. They expected a quick victory.

### Segment 2: The Rape of Nanjing (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 17 minutes into class]**

**Content Warning:**
What follows describes extreme violence. These events are historically essential to understand but disturbing to discuss.

**The Fall of Shanghai:**
Japan expected to conquer China in three months. The Battle of Shanghai (August-November 1937) proved otherwise. Chinese troops, including Chiang's best German-trained divisions, fought ferociously for three months, inflicting heavy Japanese casualties.

But Shanghai fell in November. The road to the capital, Nanjing, lay open.

**Nanjing Falls (December 13, 1937):**
Chiang's government had already retreated up the Yangzi River. When Japanese troops entered Nanjing on December 13, they encountered a city of perhaps 500,000 people—including tens of thousands of Chinese soldiers who had been unable to escape.

**[Click slide: Map showing Japanese advance to Nanjing]**

**The Massacre:**
What followed over the next six weeks was one of the worst atrocities in modern warfare:

- **Mass executions:** Japanese troops systematically killed Chinese prisoners of war and civilians. Men were used for bayonet practice, beheading contests, and machine-gun target practice. Estimates of those killed range from 100,000 to 300,000.

- **Sexual violence:** Japanese soldiers raped tens of thousands of women—estimates range from 20,000 to 80,000. Victims ranged from young girls to elderly women. Many were killed after being raped.

- **Destruction:** Japanese forces looted and burned much of the city.

**[Instructor note: Handle this material with appropriate gravity. Students may have strong emotional reactions. Consider providing content warnings before class.]**

**Foreign Witnesses:**
A small group of Western nationals—missionaries, businessmen, a Nazi Party member named John Rabe—remained in Nanjing and established a "Safety Zone" to protect civilians. Their diaries and letters provide crucial documentation of the atrocities.

American missionary Minnie Vautrin wrote: "There probably is no crime that has not been committed in this city today... Oh, God, control the wild beasts."

John Rabe, using his status as a Nazi to confront Japanese soldiers, recorded daily horrors in his diary. He estimated that "at least 50,000 to 60,000 civilians" had been killed.

**Why Did It Happen?**
Historians have offered various explanations:
- Rage at unexpectedly heavy Japanese casualties at Shanghai
- Breakdown of discipline after commanders signaled atrocities would be tolerated
- Racism—Japanese propaganda depicted Chinese as subhuman
- Deliberate terror intended to break Chinese resistance

**Historical Memory:**
The Nanjing Massacre remains deeply contested:
- In China, it is commemorated annually and taught as national trauma
- In Japan, right-wing groups have denied or minimized the atrocities
- Disputes over the massacre continue to poison Sino-Japanese relations

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Reflection Prompt:** "How should societies remember atrocities like the Nanjing Massacre? What purposes does historical memory serve? What dangers can arise from how such events are remembered—or forgotten?"

[Allow students to reflect briefly]

### Segment 3: Two Paths Through the War (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** The fall of Nanjing was not the end—it was the beginning of eight years of resistance. But the Nationalists and Communists experienced the war very differently, with consequences that would shape the postwar struggle.

**The Nationalist Retreat:**
The Nationalist government retreated up the Yangzi to Wuhan, then further inland to Chongqing in Sichuan province. Factories were dismantled and shipped upstream. Universities relocated. Millions of refugees fled west.

**[Click slide: Map showing Nationalist retreat to Chongqing]**

**Strategic Decision:**
In June 1938, facing Japanese advance along the Yellow River, Chiang ordered the river dikes blown up. The resulting flood killed somewhere between 500,000 and 900,000 Chinese civilians and displaced millions more.

It delayed the Japanese advance by three months.

**The Wartime Nationalist State:**
From Chongqing, the Nationalists continued resistance but faced enormous challenges:

- **Loss of industrial base:** Japan controlled the coastal cities and most of China's modern economy
- **Inflation:** Cut off from customs revenue, the government printed money, leading to catastrophic inflation
- **Army deterioration:** The best troops had died defending Shanghai; replacements were poorly trained conscripts, often press-ganged into service
- **Corruption:** Wartime conditions bred massive corruption among officials
- **Demoralization:** By the war's later years, many Nationalist troops and officials had given up hope

**International Support:**
The Nationalists received some foreign aid:
- Soviet advisers and equipment (until 1941)
- American Lend-Lease supplies (after Pearl Harbor)
- The Burma Road, later American airlift "over the Hump"

But aid was never enough. American general Joseph Stilwell, sent to coordinate with Chiang, became increasingly frustrated with Nationalist inefficiency and corruption.

**The Communist War:**
The Communists faced the war from a very different position:

- **Behind enemy lines:** Communist forces operated in rural areas behind Japanese lines, organizing peasants and harassing the occupiers
- **Expansion:** The party grew from about 40,000 members in 1937 to over 1.2 million by 1945. The Red Army grew from 92,000 to nearly 1 million.
- **Base areas:** By war's end, Communist base areas contained perhaps 100 million people

**Why Did Communists Grow?**

Several factors explain Communist expansion:

1. **Nationalism:** Communists could present themselves as patriotic resisters while the Nationalists appeared to be passively waiting in Chongqing

2. **Land reform:** In base areas, Communists implemented moderate land reform that won peasant support

3. **Good behavior:** Communist troops, unlike either Japanese or Nationalist forces, generally treated peasants decently

4. **Organization:** The party's cellular structure allowed it to operate effectively in guerrilla conditions

5. **Message:** Communist propaganda combined nationalism with promises of social justice

**A Peasant's Perspective:**
A peasant in north China encountered Japanese troops who burned his village, Nationalist troops who took his grain, and Communist troops who reduced his rent, taught his children to read, and asked for his support. Which would he favor?

### Segment 4: The Yan'an Way and Wartime Mobilization (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 44 minutes into class]**

**The Yan'an Model Matures:**
The war years saw the Communist Party refine its approach to revolution:

**Mass Line:**
Mao articulated the "mass line"—the idea that party policies should come "from the masses, to the masses." Cadres were supposed to listen to peasant concerns, translate them into policy, and then explain policies back to the people.

In practice, this often meant genuine responsiveness to local conditions—adjusting policies when they provoked resistance.

**Rectification Campaign (1942-1944):**
Mao also used the war years to consolidate his ideological authority. The "Rectification Campaign" required all party members to study Mao's writings and confess ideological errors.

Those who resisted, like the writer Wang Shiwei, were destroyed. The campaign established Mao Zedong Thought as the party's guiding ideology and eliminated potential rivals.

**The Seventh Party Congress (1945):**
In April 1945, the party held its first congress since 1928. The new party constitution enshrined "Mao Zedong Thought" as the party's guide "in all work." Mao's dominance was now complete.

**Military Strategy:**
Communist forces avoided major battles with the Japanese, focusing on guerrilla warfare:
- Ambushes and raids
- Cutting communication lines
- Intelligence gathering
- Building local support

Critics accused them of avoiding real fighting. Defenders argued they were preserving forces for the inevitable postwar confrontation with the Nationalists.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 52 minutes into class]**

**Quick Analysis:** "By 1945, the Communists controlled large base areas with organized populations, while the Nationalists controlled cities but faced inflation, corruption, and demoralized troops. Based on what we've discussed, how do you think the postwar struggle would unfold?"

[Brief student discussion]

## CLOSING: Victory and Its Costs (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Japan's Surrender:**
On August 15, 1945, following atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki and Soviet invasion of Manchuria, Japan surrendered. The war that had killed 15-20 million Chinese was over.

**The War's Legacy:**
But what kind of China emerged from the war?

- The Nationalist government had survived but was gravely weakened—financially bankrupt, militarily depleted, morally compromised
- The Communist Party had been transformed from a marginal guerrilla force into a mass movement with a battle-tested army
- Millions of peasants had been politicized, many for the first time
- Japanese-occupied areas contained a power vacuum that both parties rushed to fill

**Looking Forward:**
American observers hoped the Nationalists and Communists could form a coalition government, avoiding civil war. They would be disappointed.

Next time, we examine the final act: the Chinese Civil War of 1946-1949, the Communist victory, and the birth of the People's Republic.

**Closing Thought:**
The war against Japan was China's greatest catastrophe of the twentieth century—perhaps of any century. But from its ashes emerged the forces that would remake China completely. The peasants who learned to organize in wartime base areas, the cadres who learned to mobilize populations, the soldiers who learned guerrilla tactics—they would carry those lessons into the civil war and beyond.
