# CHAPTER 24: REMAKING CHINA (1900-1927)
## Three-Lecture Series Overview

**Time Period:** 1900-1927

**Series Learning Objectives:**
1. Analyze the multiple factors that led to the collapse of China's two-thousand-year imperial system and the challenges of building a modern nation-state
2. Evaluate how Chinese intellectuals and activists attempted to reconcile traditional values with modern Western ideas about government, society, and culture
3. Explain how foreign imperialism and the global context shaped China's revolutionary movements and national identity
4. Compare different visions for China's future—constitutional monarchy, republic, warlordism, communism, and nationalism—and the forces that determined which would prevail

**Connection Between Lectures:**
This series traces China's tumultuous transformation from a crumbling empire to an emerging nation-state. Lecture 1 examines the political collapse of the Qing Dynasty and the failed experiments in constitutional and republican government. Lecture 2 explores the cultural revolution that paralleled political change—the New Culture Movement's attack on Confucianism, the emergence of modern Chinese identity, and the May Fourth awakening. Lecture 3 follows the path from intellectual awakening to political action, culminating in the Nationalist reunification under Chiang Kaishek.

**How This Complements the Textbook:**
While the textbook provides excellent coverage of key events and figures, these lectures will emphasize the lived experience of ordinary Chinese during this period of upheaval, the intellectual debates that shaped competing visions for China's future, and the ways foreign intervention shaped domestic politics. We'll use primary sources—particularly Lu Xun's essays and New Youth magazine debates—to help students hear Chinese voices grappling with modernity.

# LECTURE 1: The Dragon Falls
## The Collapse of Imperial China and the Birth of the Republic (1900-1916)

**Total Lecture Time:** 50 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain how the Boxer Protocol of 1901 fatally weakened the Qing Dynasty's legitimacy and finances
2. Analyze the paradox of Qing reform efforts that accelerated rather than prevented the dynasty's collapse
3. Evaluate Sun Yatsen's revolutionary ideology and his role in the 1911 Revolution
4. Assess why the transition from empire to republic failed to produce stable democratic government

---

### Lecture Theme

The fall of China's two-thousand-year imperial system came not with a dramatic confrontation between tradition and modernity, but through a series of improvised compromises that satisfied no one. This lecture examines how the Qing Dynasty's desperate attempts at self-preservation paradoxically hastened its demise, and how the revolutionary moment of 1911 was seized not by idealistic republicans but by military strongmen who would plunge China into a decade of warlord chaos.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow Sun Yatsen's journey from a young medical student cutting off his queue in Hawaii to the man mythologized as the "Father of the Nation"—while examining how little actual role he played in the revolution that bears his name. Sun's story illuminates both the power of revolutionary ideas and the gap between ideology and political reality that would haunt China's Republican experiment.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Framing the Revolution:** Historians have long debated whether 1911 was a genuine revolution or merely a transfer of power among elites. Joseph Esherick's classic study challenged the traditional narrative by showing that the revolution succeeded precisely in those areas where local elites had the most to gain from breaking with Beijing. More recently, scholars like Rebecca Karl have emphasized the global context—how Chinese revolutionaries drew on anarchist, socialist, and nationalist ideas circulating worldwide. We'll use this lens of "revolution from above" versus "revolution from below" to understand why 1911 changed so much and so little.

### Structure Outline

## OPENING: The Queue Comes Off (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display image of men cutting off their queues after the 1911 Revolution

Begin with the powerful symbolism of the queue—the braided hairstyle Manchu rulers had forced upon Chinese men since 1645 as a mark of submission. For 267 years, Chinese men wore this visible badge of conquest. After the 1911 Revolution, men across China cut off their queues as a mark of solidarity with the revolutionaries.

**Opening Question:** "What does it mean when people change their appearance to signal political allegiance? Can you think of modern examples?"

[Allow 1-2 minutes for student responses]

**Transition:** The queue-cutting symbolized a profound break with the past—but as we'll see today, breaking with the past proved far easier than building something new. The men who cut their queues in 1912 could not have imagined that within five years, China would be fractured among dozens of warlords, the republican experiment in ruins.

**Preview:** Today we trace the final years of China's last dynasty and the troubled birth of the Republic. We'll see how the Qing court's desperate reform efforts backfired, how a revolution succeeded almost by accident, and how the hopes of 1911 gave way to the chaos of warlord rule.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Humiliation That Changed Everything—The Boxer Protocol (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Opening the Segment:**
When we last examined the Qing Dynasty [in Chapter 18], we saw a dynasty humiliated by opium wars and unequal treaties. But nothing compared to the humiliation of 1900-1901.

**The Boxer Crisis and Its Aftermath:**
The Boxer Rebellion—that strange alliance between Qing court conservatives and rural militias attacking foreigners and Chinese Christians—ended in catastrophe. Eight foreign powers invaded China. The Empress Dowager Cixi fled the capital dressed as a peasant. And when it was over, China faced the most punishing treaty in its history.

**The Boxer Protocol's Crushing Terms:**
The Boxer Protocol of 1901 imposed an indemnity of 450 million silver dollars—an almost incomprehensible sum. To put this in perspective: it was twice what Japan had extracted just six years earlier, and it equaled nearly twice the Qing government's entire annual revenue. China would pay this debt for thirty-nine years, with interest, out of customs revenue—the same customs revenue already pledged to pay earlier indemnities.

**[Click slide: Chart showing Qing finances before and after Boxer Protocol]**

Little was left for the ordinary operation of government, much less investment in modernization.

**Key Point:** The Boxer Protocol didn't just impoverish the Qing state—it destroyed its credibility. A government that could not protect its people from foreign invasion, and that then bankrupted itself paying for that failure, had lost the "Mandate of Heaven" in the eyes of many Chinese.

**Local Activism Emerges:**
Forced to look after their own interests, local elites increasingly took on modernization projects themselves. New schools proliferated—by one estimate, their numbers increased tenfold between 1901 and 1910. Local elites established new periodicals, reformed local government, and began to imagine a China not dependent on the dysfunctional Qing court.

### Segment 2: The Paradox of Qing Reform (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 19 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** Here's the paradox at the heart of the Qing's final decade: the dynasty's most ambitious reform efforts actually accelerated its collapse.

**The New Policies:**
After fleeing Beijing during the Boxer crisis, Empress Dowager Cixi returned chastened. She approved sweeping reforms she had violently opposed just three years earlier:
- 1905: Abolition of the civil service examination system (after 1,300 years!)
- New military academies trained by German and Japanese advisers
- Plans for a constitutional monarchy modeled on Japan
- Provincial assemblies elected in 1909

**[Instructor note: Emphasize the 1905 abolition of examinations—students may not grasp its revolutionary significance. This was like abolishing the entire system of university degrees and professional credentials overnight.]**

**Why Reform Backfired:**
Each reform, intended to strengthen the dynasty, instead created new sources of opposition:
- The new schools produced students with radical ideas
- The new armies were loyal to their commanders, not the throne
- The provincial assemblies gave local elites an organized voice to demand more power
- The end of examinations eliminated the ladder by which talented men rose through the imperial system, creating a generation of frustrated intellectuals

**The Constitutional Movement:**
The 1909 provincial assembly elections generated genuine enthusiasm. Provincial representatives sent three petitions to Beijing demanding immediate convening of a national parliament—the third reportedly signed by 25 million people. But when the court finally announced its cabinet in May 1911, eight of thirteen members were Manchu, including several princes. The message was clear: the Manchus would share power with no one.

**Key Point:** By trying to modernize while maintaining Manchu dominance, the Qing satisfied neither conservatives who wanted to preserve tradition nor reformers who wanted genuine change.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "The Qing court faced an impossible dilemma: reforms strong enough to save the dynasty would be strong enough to destroy Manchu power, but reforms that preserved Manchu power wouldn't save the dynasty. Can you think of other historical examples where ruling groups faced similar impossible choices?"

[Allow students to discuss briefly with neighbors, then take 1-2 responses]

**Possible connections:** Soviet reforms under Gorbachev, apartheid South Africa, contemporary authoritarian regimes attempting controlled liberalization

### Segment 3: Sun Yatsen and the Revolutionary Alternative (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Introducing Sun Yatsen:**
While reformers tried to work within the system, revolutionaries wanted to tear it down entirely. The most famous was Sun Yatsen (Sun Zhongshan, 1866-1925).

**Sun's Unusual Background:**
Sun was an outsider in almost every way. He came from Guangdong province in the far south, not from the literati class. At age thirteen, he emigrated to Hawaii to join a brother. He converted to Christianity, studied Western medicine in Hong Kong, and absorbed ideas about republicanism and democracy that would have seemed alien to most Chinese of his generation.

**[Click slide: Early photograph of Sun Yatsen]**

In 1896, Sun gained international fame when the Qing legation in London kidnapped him, planning to ship him back to China for execution. His British friends secured his release, and "the kidnapped revolutionary" became a celebrity in the Western press.

**The Three Principles of the People:**
Sun developed an ideology he called the "Three Principles of the People":
1. **Nationalism** (minzu)—opposing both Manchu rule and foreign imperialism
2. **Democracy** (minquan)—establishing a republic with elected government
3. **People's Livelihood** (minsheng)—a vague socialism promising land reform and limits on capitalism

**[Instructor note: Students may recognize the "Three Principles" from Taiwan, where they remained official ideology until recently. Connect to modern relevance if time permits.]**

**Revolutionary Organization:**
Sun formed the Revolutionary Alliance (Tongmenghui) in 1905, uniting various anti-Qing groups. But here's the irony: Sun himself was abroad fundraising when the actual revolution happened. He learned of the revolution's success from a newspaper while in Denver, Colorado.

**The Anti-Manchu Dimension:**
The revolution had a powerful ethnic dimension that modern Chinese history often downplays. Revolutionary pamphlets called for Han Chinese to "wipe out the five million barbarian Manchus" and "wash away the shame of two hundred sixty years." One 1903 tract by the nineteen-year-old Zou Rong called for a "revolutionary army" to make China a "sacred Han" nation. This racial nationalism would fade from Sun's later ideology, but it was central to revolutionary mobilization.

### Segment 4: The Revolution of 1911—Almost an Accident (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 42 minutes into class]**

**The Wuchang Uprising:**
On October 10, 1911, in Wuchang (part of modern Wuhan), a bomb accidentally exploded in the headquarters of a revolutionary group. When police came to investigate, they found lists of revolutionary members among army officers. Faced with arrest and execution, the implicated officers had nothing to lose—they staged a coup and took over the city.

Within six weeks, fifteen provinces had declared independence from the Qing.

**Why Did It Succeed?**
The revolution succeeded not because of revolutionary strength but because of Qing weakness:
- The new armies were loyal to their commanders, not the dynasty
- Provincial elites saw an opportunity to increase their power
- The court turned in desperation to Yuan Shikai—the very general Cixi had dismissed for being too powerful

**The Compromise:**
The Qing court offered Yuan Shikai everything: command of all armies, power to negotiate with revolutionaries. Yuan, seeing which way the wind was blowing, negotiated a deal: the emperor would abdicate, Yuan would become president, and the Manchu royal family would receive generous pensions and be allowed to remain in the Forbidden City.

In February 1912, the last Qing emperor—a six-year-old boy named Puyi—abdicated. China's imperial system, which had begun with Qin Shihuang over two thousand years earlier, was over.

**[Click slide: Last emperor Puyi as a child]**

**The Republic That Never Was:**
Sun Yatsen briefly served as provisional president, then graciously stepped aside for Yuan Shikai. It was a fatal mistake. Within two years, Yuan had:
- Assassinated the leading Nationalist organizer, Song Jiaoren
- Outlawed the Nationalist Party
- Abolished provincial assemblies
- Declared himself emperor (though he died before the coronation)

When Yuan died in 1916, no central authority remained. China fragmented among regional warlords who would fight each other for the next decade.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 50 minutes into class]**

**Reflection Prompt:** "The 1911 Revolution ended two thousand years of imperial rule but failed to create stable republican government. Based on what we've discussed today, identify two specific factors that help explain why the transition failed. What might have been done differently?"

[Students can jot down thoughts for use in discussion next class]

## CLOSING: The Cost of Chaos (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
The fall of the Qing demonstrated that destroying an old order was far easier than building a new one. The revolutionaries had compelling criticisms of imperial rule but no realistic plan for governing a vast, diverse country. The result was a decade of warlord rule that brought suffering to millions.

**Looking Forward:**
But even as warlords battled for territory, a profound cultural revolution was underway. Young intellectuals were asking not just what kind of government China should have, but what kind of people the Chinese should become. Next time, we'll examine the New Culture Movement—China's most radical attack on its own traditions—and the May Fourth awakening that would shape Chinese politics for the rest of the century.
