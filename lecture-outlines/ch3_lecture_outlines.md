# LECTURE 1: The Qin Unification and the First Emperor (256–206 B.C.E.)

## Learning Objectives
- Explain how the peripheral state of Qin conquered all of China
- Analyze the role of Legalism in Qin's success and governance
- Evaluate the First Emperor's standardization programs and their lasting impact
- Assess the reasons for the Qin Dynasty's rapid collapse

## Lecture Outline

### I. Introduction: From Warring States to Empire (5 minutes)
- **Opening hook**: By 230 BCE, seven major states had been at war for over two centuries. Within nine years, one state would conquer them all.
- **Big question**: How did Qin—a frontier state considered semi-barbaric by the eastern kingdoms—create China's first unified empire?
- **Chapter context**: This lecture covers the first major section of Chapter 3, "The Qin Unification (256–206 B.C.E.)"

### II. Qin's Rise to Power (10 minutes)

#### A. Geographic and Military Advantages
- Northwestern location: protected by mountains, hardened by warfare with Rong and Di peoples
- Access to Wei River valley—fertile agricultural base
- Development of superior cavalry and military tactics through frontier conflicts

#### B. The Legalist Transformation
- **Lord Shang's reforms** (4th century BCE): Abolished aristocratic privileges, divided country into counties administered by appointed officials
- Legalist principles applied:
  - Clear laws with automatic, harsh punishments
  - Military ranks based on enemy heads captured (not birth)
  - Farmers freed from serf-like obligations to local nobility
  - Migrants recruited from other states with offers of land

#### C. Chancellor Li Si and the Final Conquests

- **By 230 BCE**, the tide of war shifted decisively to Qin
- Rapid conquest of final six states: Han, Zhao, Wei, Chu, Yan, and Qi
- **221 BCE**: Unification complete

**Key terms**: Legalism (Fajia), Lord Shang, Li Si, commanderies and counties

---

### III. The First Emperor (r. 221–210 B.C.E.) (12 minutes)

#### A. Creating a New Title
- King Cheng (Zheng) decided "king" (wang) was not grand enough
- Invented the title **"emperor" (huangdi)**—combining words for "august" and "theocrat" linking him to mythical sage rulers
- Called himself the "First Emperor" (Qin Shihuangdi) anticipating a line of successors

#### B. The Program of Centralization
1. **Administrative restructuring**:
   - Abolished feudal nobility—ordered nobles to move to capital Xianyang
   - Divided empire into **commanderies and counties** administered by appointed officials
   - Officials owed their positions entirely to the emperor's favor

2. **Standardization programs**:
   - **Writing system**: Unified the different scripts used in former states (Figure 3.1 in textbook shows variations)
   - **Weights and measures**: Standard units across the empire
   - **Axle widths**: So carts could use the same road ruts
   - **Currency**: Standardized coinage

3. **Infrastructure projects**:
   - Road network connecting the empire (for military movement and communication)
   - Canals for transportation and irrigation
   - Defensive walls linked into early **Great Wall**

#### C. Thought Control: The Burning of Books
- 213 BCE: Li Si convinced the emperor to burn books that praised the old feudal ways
- **What was burned**: History books of other states, philosophical works (especially Confucian)
- **What was spared**: Practical texts on medicine, divination, agriculture; Qin's own records
- **Burial of scholars**: Tradition says 460 scholars were buried alive for criticizing the emperor
- **Scholarly debate**: Some historians question the scale of these events; original documents discovered in 1975 suggest legal system was more sophisticated than later accounts claimed

**Discussion question**: Was the First Emperor a visionary unifier or a brutal tyrant—or both? What criteria should we use to judge?

---

### 🔔 PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (5 minutes)
**Activity: Think-Pair-Share**
- Think: What are TWO things Qin did that you think had lasting positive effects, and TWO that had negative effects?
- Pair: Discuss with a neighbor
- Share: Brief class discussion

---

### IV. Qin Law and the Lives of Ordinary People (8 minutes)

#### A. The Qin Legal System
- **1975 discovery**: 625 bamboo strips with Qin laws and legal texts found in a tomb in Hubei province
- Tomb belonged to a prefectural official who served the Qin government
- Revealed a more sophisticated legal system than previously known:
  - Statutes on government granaries and labor service
  - Legal terminology explained in Q&A format
  - Detailed procedures and penalties

#### B. Harsh Punishments
- **Penalties included**: Hard labor, physical mutilation, banishment, slavery, death
- **Mutilation**: Shaving the beard, branding the forehead, cutting off the nose or left foot, castration
- **Death penalties**: Included being torn apart by horse-drawn chariots
- **Collective responsibility**: Criminals' families could be enslaved; for heinous crimes, even distant relatives punished

#### C. The Burden on Common People
- **Massive labor conscription** for walls, roads, palaces, and the emperor's tomb
- **Military service** requirements
- Government officials evaluated annually—punished if performance fell short
- Men could volunteer for frontier service for 5 years to redeem family members from slavery

**Primary source opportunity**: Quote from later Han historian Sima Qian on the harshness of Qin rule

---

### V. The Xiongnu Threat and the Great Wall (5 minutes)

#### A. Who Were the Xiongnu?
- Nomadic confederation to the north
- Economy based on animal husbandry: horses, sheep, cattle
- Tribal social organization with chiefs selected for military prowess
- By late Zhou, they had mastered mounted archery—revolutionary military technology

#### B. Qin's Response
- **General Meng Tian**: Led massive army (100,000–300,000 troops) to attack Xiongnu in 215 BCE
- Drove them out of the Ordos region
- Built 44 fortified towns and roads
- **Connected and extended defensive walls** into what became the Great Wall
- Construction required tens of thousands of conscript laborers

---

### VI. The First Emperor's Tomb and Quest for Immortality (5 minutes)

#### A. Fear of Death
- Three assassination attempts made the emperor obsessed with security and immortality
- Sent expeditions to find the "isles of immortality" in the Eastern Sea
- Listened to magicians who claimed to know techniques for achieving immortality

#### B. The Terracotta Army
- Massive underground tomb complex near modern Xi'an
- **Thousands of life-sized terra-cotta soldiers** discovered in 1974
- Originally painted in bright colors; held real bronze weapons
- Each soldier has unique facial features
- Also includes terra-cotta horses, chariots, officials, acrobats

#### C. What the Tomb Reveals
- The emperor's concern with the afterlife
- His government's ability to organize production on a massive scale
- According to Sima Qian: workers and craftsmen sealed inside the tomb to protect its secrets; childless concubines buried with the emperor

**Image opportunity**: Photos of terracotta warriors

---

### VII. The Collapse of Qin (5 minutes)

#### A. The Second Emperor's Failures
- First Emperor died in 210 BCE while traveling
- **Li Si and eunuch Zhao Gao** conspired to alter the succession
- Forced the designated heir to commit suicide; installed a weaker son as Second Emperor
- Second Emperor was manipulated by Zhao Gao; executed Li Si

#### B. Rebellion Erupts
- **209 BCE**: Two conscript laborers (Chen Sheng and Wu Guang) led a revolt when they couldn't reach their assigned posts on time
- Punishment for lateness was death—they had nothing to lose
- Rebellion spread rapidly across the empire
- Former nobles and generals from conquered states rose up

#### C. The End of Qin
- Multiple rebel armies formed
- **Xiang Yu**: Aristocratic general from Chu, most powerful military force
- **Liu Bang**: Commoner who led a smaller but effective force
- **206 BCE**: Qin dynasty collapsed—lasted only 15 years after unification

**Transition to next lecture**: The contest between Xiang Yu and Liu Bang would determine who would rule the newly unified China—and what kind of government it would have.

---

### VIII. Conclusion and Key Takeaways (3 minutes)

#### Why Did Qin Fail?
- Overextension: too many massive projects requiring conscript labor
- Harsh laws that alienated the population
- No mechanism for peaceful succession
- Relied entirely on force, not legitimacy

#### Lasting Legacy
- Despite its brevity, Qin established the template for Chinese imperial governance:
  - Centralized bureaucracy over feudalism
  - Standardized systems for weights, measures, writing
  - The title "emperor" and concept of unified China
- Later dynasties would learn from Qin's mistakes while keeping its innovations

**Preview**: Next lecture—the founding of the Han Dynasty and the question of how to govern a vast empire without Qin's brutality.

# LECTURE 2: The Han Dynasty—Founding, Governance, and the Confucian Turn (206 B.C.E.–9 C.E.)

## Learning Objectives
- Trace the founding of the Han Dynasty and Liu Bang's rise from commoner to emperor
- Compare Han governance with Qin—what changed and what remained the same
- Explain the adoption of Confucianism as state ideology under Emperor Wu
- Analyze the role of empresses, eunuchs, and consort families in Han politics

## Lecture Outline

### I. Introduction: Learning from Qin's Mistakes (5 minutes)
- **Opening question**: The Qin created China's first empire but collapsed in 15 years. What lessons did its successors learn?
- **The Han achievement**: Created a dynasty lasting over 400 years (with a brief interruption)—one of the five major dynasties (Han, Tang, Song, Ming, Qing)
- **Chapter context**: This lecture covers "The Han Dynasty (206 B.C.E.–220 C.E.)" focusing on founding, governance, and ideology

---

### II. The Contest for Empire: Liu Bang vs. Xiang Yu (8 minutes)

#### A. Two Very Different Leaders
| Xiang Yu | Liu Bang |
|----------|----------|
| Aristocratic background (Chu nobility) | Commoner (village headman) |
| Brilliant military commander | Mediocre general but skilled at delegation |
| Proud, suspicious of advisors | Humble, listened to advisors |
| Ruled through terror and violence | Built coalitions through rewards |

#### B. The Civil War (206–202 BCE)
- After Qin fell, Xiang Yu dominated but made enemies
- He divided the empire among 18 kings—including Liu Bang as King of Han (in the remote west)
- Liu Bang attracted talented advisors and generals
- Gradually consolidated power through strategic alliances

#### C. Liu Bang's Victory
- **202 BCE**: Liu Bang defeated Xiang Yu at the Battle of Gaixia
- Xiang Yu committed suicide rather than surrender
- Liu Bang declared the **Han Dynasty**
- Took the title **Emperor Gaozu** ("High Ancestor")
- Established capital at **Chang'an** (near modern Xi'an)

**Anecdote to share**: Liu Bang's famous question to his advisors—"Why did I win and Xiang Yu lose?" They answered: because you shared rewards and listened to advice.

---

### III. Early Han Governance: A Mixed System (10 minutes)

#### A. The Compromise with Feudalism
- Liu Bang couldn't simply replicate Qin's centralized system—he needed to reward his supporters
- **Western half**: Divided into commanderies and counties (like Qin), directly administered
- **Eastern half**: Given as kingdoms to relatives and allies
- This created problems when kings became too powerful

#### B. Reducing Taxes and Easing Punishments
- Early Han emperors deliberately lightened the burden on common people
- **Reduced taxes** to one-fifteenth of the harvest (later one-thirtieth)
- **Abolished some mutilation punishments**
- Philosophy of "resting with the people" (let society recover from war)
- Drew from both **Confucian** and **Daoist** ideas about minimal government

#### C. The Problem of Powerful Kings
- Kings controlled their own territories and could become threats
- **154 BCE**: Seven kings rebelled against the central government
- Rebellion crushed, but demonstrated the danger
- Subsequent emperors gradually reduced kingdom sizes and powers

**Key transition**: The Han kept Qin's basic administrative structure but softened its harshness

---

### IV. Emperor Wu and the Confucian Turn (12 minutes)

#### A. Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE)
- One of the most important emperors in Chinese history
- Long reign allowed major transformations
- Massively expanded the empire (covered in Lecture 3)
- Made Confucianism the official state ideology

#### B. Official Support for Confucianism
- Emperor Wu privileged **Confucian scholars** within the government
- Listened to scholar **Dong Zhongshu**, who synthesized Confucian thought with yin-yang cosmology
- Decreed that officials should be selected based on knowledge of **Confucian classics**
- **Established an imperial university** (124 BCE) to train officials in the classics

#### C. What This Meant in Practice
- **Scholar-official system**: Officials trained in Confucian values became a distinctive feature of Chinese government
- Officials were expected to **admonish the ruler** against misguided policies
- Confucian emphasis on moral education rather than harsh punishments
- **However**: Emperors didn't abandon Legalist methods entirely—used both as needed

#### D. The Confucian-Legalist Synthesis
- Han government drew from **both traditions**:
  - **Confucian**: Moral education, scholar-officials, rituals, hierarchy based on virtue
  - **Legalist**: Clear laws, bureaucratic procedures, rewards and punishments
- Officials with Confucian values didn't need to be supervised as closely as Legalist model required
- This synthesis became the foundation of Chinese imperial governance

**Discussion point**: Is this combination hypocritical, or a practical way to govern a large empire?

---

### 🔔 PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (5 minutes)
**Activity: Quick Write**
- In your own words, explain ONE key difference between how Qin and Han governed.
- Why do you think the Han approach was more successful in the long term?

---

### V. Court Politics: Empresses, Eunuchs, and Consort Families (8 minutes)

#### A. The Vulnerability of the Imperial Institution
- Hereditary succession meant young children could become emperor
- **First century BCE**: Several boys succeeded to the throne
- Adult men of the imperial lineage kept out of the capital (seen as threats)
- This left power vacuums filled by others

#### B. The Role of Women at Court
- **Empress Dowagers**: Mothers or grandmothers of young emperors wielded real power
- Most famous: **Empress Lü** (widow of Liu Bang)
  - Dominated court politics after Liu Bang's death
  - Promoted her own relatives (the Lü family) to positions of power
- Women's male relatives (**consort families**) became powerful factions

#### C. Palace Eunuchs
- **Eunuchs**: Castrated men who served in the palace
- Originally: managed the emperor's private quarters, especially the women's quarters
- Gradually gained influence because they had constant access to the emperor
- By late Han, eunuchs became a powerful political faction competing with scholar-officials

#### D. Wang Mang's Usurpation
- **Wang Mang**: Relative of the empress, rose to power through the consort family system
- By 9 CE, he had accumulated enough power to depose the child emperor
- Declared a new dynasty: the **Xin ("New") Dynasty**
- Attempted radical Confucian-inspired reforms

---

### VI. Wang Mang and the Interregnum (9–23 CE) (5 minutes)

#### A. Wang Mang's Reforms
- Tried to implement idealized Confucian policies:
  - Nationalized land (to redistribute to peasants)
  - Revived public granaries
  - Limited private landholding
  - Outlawed slavery
  - Issued new coinage

#### B. Why the Reforms Failed
- Reforms alienated powerful families without helping common people
- Economic disruption from currency changes
- **Yellow River floods** in 11 CE displaced millions
- Widespread famines and rebellions

#### C. The End of Wang Mang
- **Red Eyebrow Rebellion** and other uprisings
- **23 CE**: Rebels captured the capital; Wang Mang killed
- A member of the Liu family (Han imperial house) restored the dynasty
- **25 CE**: **Eastern Han** (or Later Han) established with capital at **Luoyang**

**Key point**: Wang Mang is often condemned as a usurper, but was actually a learned Confucian scholar who tried to implement classic ideals—and failed dramatically

---

### VII. Conclusion: The Han Model of Governance (5 minutes)

#### What Made Han Governance Work?
1. **Balance**: Combined Qin's administrative efficiency with Confucian morality
2. **Flexibility**: Reduced taxes and punishments when needed
3. **Legitimacy**: Scholar-official system created shared values
4. **Adaptation**: Learned from mistakes (kingdoms, succession problems)

#### Continuities with Qin
- Basic administrative structure (commanderies and counties)
- Centralized bureaucracy
- Standardized systems

#### Key Differences from Qin
- Ideological legitimacy through Confucianism
- Lighter touch—less reliance on force
- More sophisticated approach to succession (though still problematic)

**Preview**: Next lecture—Han society, the Xiongnu wars, and the opening of the Silk Road

- Analyze Han relations with the Xiongnu and the evolution of frontier policy
- Explain the opening of the Silk Road and its significance for trade and cultural exchange
- Assess the factors that led to the Han Dynasty's decline and fall

## Lecture Outline

### I. Introduction: The World of Han China (3 minutes)
- **Opening**: The Han Dynasty governed roughly 59 million people across a vast territory
- **Today's questions**:
  - What was life like for ordinary people in Han China?
  - How did the Han deal with the powerful Xiongnu confederation?
  - What were the consequences of Han expansion into Central Asia?
- **Chapter context**: This lecture covers "Chinese Society in Han Times," "Central Asia and the Silk Road," and "Borderlands"

---

### II. Chinese Society in Han Times (12 minutes)

#### A. Population and Economy
- **Census of 2 CE**: Recorded approximately 59 million people
- Earliest indication of China's large population size
- Population grew rapidly during the peaceful early Han period
- Economy based primarily on agriculture

#### B. Common Farmers (the vast majority)
- Most Chinese were farmers living in villages
- Typical family: parents, children, sometimes grandparents
- Grew millet in the north, rice in the south
- **Tax burden**: Land tax (1/30 of harvest) + poll tax + labor service
- **Corvée labor**: Required to work on government projects (roads, walls, canals)
- Life was hard but generally better than under Qin

#### C. Landowners and the Problem of Land Concentration
- Over time, wealthy families accumulated large estates
- Poor farmers sometimes had to sell land and become tenants or laborers
- Some became **slaves** (through debt, crime, or capture)
- Government periodically tried to limit landholding—rarely successful

#### D. Merchants and Artisans
- Officially ranked **below farmers** in the social hierarchy
- Confucian ideology looked down on profit-seeking
- In practice, successful merchants could become very wealthy
- Government maintained **monopolies** on iron and salt (major revenue sources)
- Silk production was a valuable industry, mostly women's work

#### E. The Educated Elite
- Families who could afford education in the Confucian classics
- Goal: government office through recommendation or examination
- Formed a **scholar-gentry** class that would dominate Chinese society for centuries
- **The Ban Family**: Example of a successful scholarly family (see Biography box in textbook)
  - Ban Biao: Historian
  - Ban Gu: Completed the *History of the Former Han*
  - Ban Zhao: First famous female scholar, completed her brother's work, wrote *Admonitions for Women*

**Discussion question**: How does the Han social structure compare to other ancient societies you've studied?

---

### III. The Xiongnu Challenge (10 minutes)

#### A. Who Were the Xiongnu?
- **Nomadic confederation** north of China
- Economy based on herding: horses, sheep, cattle, camels
- Lived in felt tents (yurts) that could be moved
- **Military advantage**: Mounted archery—could shoot while riding at full gallop
- Social organization: tribal, with chiefs (chanyu) selected for military ability

#### B. Early Han Policy: Appeasement (Heqin)
- After disastrous defeat at **Baideng** (200 BCE), where Liu Bang was surrounded by Xiongnu cavalry
- Han adopted the **heqin** ("peace and kinship") policy:
  - Sent Chinese princesses to marry the chanyu
  - Provided annual "gifts" (tribute) of silk, grain, and other goods
  - Established border markets for trade
- This was essentially **paying off** the Xiongnu to avoid war
- Humiliating to Han pride, but practical

#### C. Emperor Wu's Aggressive Turn
- Emperor Wu (r. 141–87 BCE) reversed the appeasement policy
- Launched major military campaigns against the Xiongnu
- **Key general**: Wei Qing and Huo Qubing led cavalry armies deep into the steppes
- **Results**: Drove Xiongnu out of Ordos region; pushed them north of Gobi Desert
- **But**: Campaigns were enormously expensive; never fully defeated the Xiongnu

#### D. Long-term Consequences
- Han-Xiongnu conflict continued for centuries with periods of war and peace
- Xiongnu confederation eventually split (1st century BCE)
- Some Xiongnu groups surrendered and were settled inside China
- Pattern of relations with steppe peoples would repeat throughout Chinese history

**Key point**: The Xiongnu challenge shaped Han foreign policy, military, and economy

---

### 🔔 PAUSE & PROCESS #3 (5 minutes)
**Activity: Comparison**
- Working with a partner, identify TWO advantages the Xiongnu had and TWO advantages the Han had in their conflicts.
- Which side do you think had the overall advantage, and why?

---

### IV. Zhang Qian and the Opening of the Silk Road (10 minutes)

#### A. Zhang Qian's Mission
- **139 BCE**: Emperor Wu sent Zhang Qian to find the Yuezhi people (enemies of the Xiongnu)
- Goal: Form an alliance to attack Xiongnu from two sides
- Zhang Qian was **captured by Xiongnu** and held for 10 years
- Eventually escaped and reached Central Asia (Bactria, Ferghana)

#### B. What Zhang Qian Discovered
- The Yuezhi had no interest in alliance against Xiongnu
- **But** Zhang Qian brought back crucial intelligence:
  - Other civilizations existed to the west (Parthia, India)
  - Trade was already occurring (he saw Chinese silk in Central Asian markets!)
  - The "heavenly horses" of Ferghana were superior to Chinese horses

#### C. The Silk Road Opens
- Zhang Qian's reports inspired Emperor Wu to expand westward
- **104–102 BCE**: Han armies conquered Ferghana to obtain horses
- Han established military colonies and protectorates in Central Asia
- **Silk Road** emerged as network of trade routes connecting:
  - China → Central Asia → Persia → Rome

#### D. What Traveled the Silk Road
**Going West from China:**
- Silk (the primary luxury export)
- Lacquerware
- Bronze mirrors
- Paper (later)

**Coming East to China:**
- Horses (especially from Ferghana)
- Gold, silver, gems
- Glass
- Wool textiles
- New foods: grapes, pomegranates, walnuts, sesame, coriander

**Ideas and religions:**
- Buddhism entered China via the Silk Road (1st century CE)
- Artistic styles and technologies exchanged

#### E. Material Culture: Silk from the Silk Road
- Chinese silk production was ancient (domesticated silkworms since Shang period)
- Silk textiles found in Central Asian sites show Chinese craftsmanship
- Example from textbook: Silk arm cover excavated at Niya along the Silk Road
- Inscriptions on silk show military and political messages

**Key insight**: The Silk Road was never one road but a network; trade was conducted in stages by different merchants

---

### V. Borderlands and Expansion (5 minutes)

#### A. Southern Expansion
- Han expanded into what is now southern China and northern Vietnam
- Indigenous peoples (like the Dian in Yunnan) were conquered and incorporated
- **Migration pattern**: Chinese settlers moved south along rivers, displacing indigenous populations
- Government built garrisons and established counties to assimilate frontier regions

#### B. Korean Peninsula
- Han established commanderies in northern Korea (108 BCE)
- **Lelang Commandery** near modern Pyongyang lasted for centuries
- Spread Chinese writing, culture, and political institutions to Korea

#### C. The Costs of Empire
- Expansion required massive military expenditures
- Garrisons had to be supplied and defended
- Government monopolies on salt and iron increased to fund wars
- Some historians argue Emperor Wu's expansion **overextended** the empire

---

### VI. Intellectual and Religious Currents (5 minutes)

#### A. Han Confucianism
- Not identical to original Confucianism of Confucius and Mencius
- **Dong Zhongshu** synthesized Confucianism with:
  - Yin-yang theory
  - Five phases (wuxing)
  - Belief in cosmic resonance between Heaven and human affairs
- Natural disasters interpreted as Heaven's warning to the emperor

#### B. Popular Religion
- Belief in spirits, ghosts, and the afterlife
- Elaborate tomb furnishings for life after death
- Divination and selection of lucky/unlucky days remained important
- **Documents: Lucky and Unlucky Days** (see primary source in textbook)

#### C. The Arrival of Buddhism
- Buddhist missionaries and merchants began arriving via the Silk Road (1st century CE)
- Initially attracted little attention
- Would grow to become major religion in later centuries

---

### VII. The Decline and Fall of the Han (5 minutes)

#### A. Problems of the Later Han
- **Land concentration**: Wealthy families accumulated estates; peasants lost land
- **Eunuch vs. scholar-official factions**: Struggled for influence at court
- **Weak emperors**: Often young, manipulated by eunuchs or consort families
- **Tax base eroded** as powerful families evaded taxes

#### B. The Yellow Turban Rebellion (184 CE)
- Massive peasant uprising inspired by Daoist religious movement
- Rebels wore yellow scarves (symbolic of earth element replacing fire/Han)
- Government suppressed the rebellion but had to rely on regional warlords
- Warlords became increasingly powerful and independent

#### C. The End of Han
- **189 CE**: Civil war erupted at the capital
- Eunuchs massacred; warlords fought for control
- **220 CE**: Last Han emperor abdicated
- China fragmented into the **Three Kingdoms** (Wei, Shu, Wu)—later romanticized in famous novel

**Looking ahead**: China would not be reunified for nearly 400 years (until the Sui Dynasty in 589 CE)

---

### VIII. Conclusion: The Han Legacy (3 minutes)

#### Why the Han Matters
1. **Longevity**: Over 400 years (with Wang Mang interruption)—established China as a lasting civilization
2. **Identity**: Chinese people still call themselves "Han people" (Han ren); Chinese characters are "Han characters" (Hanzi)
3. **Governance model**: Confucian scholar-officials became the norm for 2,000 years
4. **Territorial definition**: Han borders roughly define "China proper"
5. **Cultural exchange**: Silk Road connected China to wider world

#### Key Questions for Further Reflection
- Was Han expansion beneficial or costly in the long run?
- How did the combination of Confucianism and Legalism shape Chinese government?
- What patterns do we see in the Han that will repeat in later dynasties?

**Preview for next unit**: The Period of Division—Buddhism transforms China, north and south develop differently, and new peoples enter the Chinese world
