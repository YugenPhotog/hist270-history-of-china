# CHAPTER 25: WAR AND REVOLUTION, CHINA (1927-1949)
## Three-Lecture Series Overview

**Time Period:** 1927-1949

**Series Learning Objectives:**
1. Analyze the competing visions for China's future represented by the Nationalist and Communist parties and explain why the Communists ultimately prevailed
2. Evaluate the impact of Japanese invasion on both the Nationalist government and the Communist movement
3. Explain how Mao Zedong adapted Marxist theory to Chinese conditions and built a revolutionary movement based on peasant mobilization
4. Assess the roles of ideology, military strategy, foreign intervention, and popular support in determining the outcome of the Chinese Civil War

**Connection Between Lectures:**
This series traces China's path through two decades of war—civil war, foreign invasion, and civil war again—culminating in the Communist victory of 1949. Lecture 1 examines the divergent paths of Nationalists and Communists in the 1930s: Chiang's modernizing but authoritarian government versus Mao's peasant revolution in the remote countryside. Lecture 2 follows the catastrophe of Japanese invasion, which nearly destroyed China but paradoxically allowed the Communists to grow. Lecture 3 traces the final confrontation between Nationalist and Communist forces, explaining why a government with every material advantage collapsed so quickly.

**How This Complements the Textbook:**
While the textbook covers the major political and military events, these lectures will emphasize the human experience of these tumultuous decades—the cosmopolitan world of 1930s Shanghai, the suffering of the Long March, life in wartime Chongqing and Yan'an, and the collapse of Nationalist morale. We'll use primary sources, including Wang Shiwei's controversial essays and eyewitness accounts, to hear Chinese voices across the political spectrum.

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Evaluate the achievements and failures of the Nationalist government during the Nanjing Decade (1928-1937)
2. Explain how Mao Zedong developed a revolutionary strategy based on peasant mobilization rather than urban workers
3. Analyze the conditions in the Jiangxi Soviet and why the Communists were forced to undertake the Long March
4. Compare the visions for China's future represented by the Nationalists in Nanjing and the Communists in Yan'an

### Lecture Theme

After 1927, China had not one government but two competing visions for the nation's future. In Nanjing, Chiang Kaishek built a modernizing authoritarian state that brought real improvements to cities while leaving the countryside largely untouched. In the mountains of Jiangxi, Mao Zedong was developing something unprecedented: a communist revolution based not on factory workers but on poor peasants. This lecture examines how these two Chinas developed in parallel—and why one would ultimately defeat the other.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow Mao Zedong's transformation from one of many Communist organizers to the party's paramount leader. His journey—from studying peasant movements in Hunan, through the desperate retreat of the Long March, to establishing his base at Yan'an—reveals how revolutionary theory was forged through trial, error, and near-annihilation. Mao's story is also the story of the Communist Party learning, often painfully, what kind of revolution was possible in China.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**The "Lost Chance" Debate:** For decades, historians have debated whether the United States "lost" China by failing to support the Communists against Chiang Kaishek. This framing assumed American actions could have determined China's fate. More recent scholarship has shifted focus to Chinese agency—examining how internal factors, particularly the Nationalists' failure to address rural poverty and the Communists' success in mobilizing peasants, determined the outcome. Odd Arne Westad's work emphasizes how both parties' ideological commitments, not just practical politics, shaped their destinies. We'll examine how the seeds of 1949's outcome were planted in the very different Chinas that emerged after 1927.

### Structure Outline

## OPENING: Two Photographs (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display two contrasting images side by side—glamorous 1930s Shanghai and a peasant village

**Opening Setup:**
Present two photographs from 1930s China:
1. The Bund in Shanghai—Art Deco skyscrapers, automobiles, fashionable women in qipao dresses
2. A village in rural Jiangxi—mud houses, farmers in traditional clothes, no electricity or running water

**Opening Question:** "Both photographs are from China in 1935. What do they suggest about the country and its challenges?"

[Allow students to observe and comment]

**The Point:**
These weren't just different places—they represented different *worlds* within the same country. The average resident of Shanghai's International Settlement lived in conditions comparable to Europe or America. The average Chinese peasant lived much as their ancestors had a thousand years earlier.

**Transition:** This gap—between modern coastal cities and the vast, impoverished countryside—was the central fact of Chinese life in the 1930s. The Nationalist government in Nanjing focused on the cities. The Communist Party, nearly destroyed in 1927, retreated to the countryside—and there discovered the force that would eventually carry them to power.

**Preview:** Today we examine the two Chinas of the 1930s: the Nationalist modernization project and its limits, and the peasant revolution Mao Zedong was building in the mountains.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Nanjing Decade—Modernization from Above (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Setting the Scene:**
After the Northern Expedition unified China (at least nominally), the Nationalist government established its capital at Nanjing in 1928. For the next decade—until Japanese invasion forced a retreat—the Nationalists attempted to build a modern Chinese state.

**Real Achievements:**
The Nanjing Decade brought genuine progress:

- **Legal reform:** New civil and criminal codes based on European models; women gained the legal right to initiate divorce
- **Infrastructure:** Thousands of miles of new roads and railways
- **Education:** Expansion of universities and primary schools
- **International recognition:** China regained control of customs, the salt monopoly, and most foreign concessions
- **Professional class:** Emergence of engineers, doctors, lawyers, architects trained in Western methods

**[Click slide: Chart showing growth indicators 1928-1937]**

**Shanghai as Showcase:**
Shanghai embodied the possibilities and contradictions of Nationalist China. By the 1930s, it had 4 million residents and was one of the world's great cities. It had half of China's modern industry, international banks, department stores, movie studios, jazz clubs, and a thriving publishing industry.

The city attracted refugees from everywhere—White Russians fleeing Bolshevism, Jews fleeing Nazism, Chinese intellectuals fleeing censorship. You could walk from the French Concession to the International Settlement to the Chinese city, crossing legal jurisdictions with each step.

**[Click slide: 1930s Shanghai skyline—the Bund]**

**The Dark Side:**
But Shanghai also revealed the limits of Nationalist modernization:

- The Treaty Port system remained—foreigners still enjoyed extraterritorial rights
- An estimated 50,000 women worked as prostitutes, many as virtual slaves
- The Green Gang crime syndicate, allied with Chiang, controlled much of the economy
- Workers faced brutal conditions with little protection
- The city depended on cheap labor drawn from the impoverished countryside

**The Countryside Problem:**
Most critically, the Nationalists failed to address rural China:

- No significant land reform despite Sun Yatsen's promises
- Peasants continued paying crushing rents to landlords
- Little improvement in education, healthcare, or infrastructure in villages
- Population pressure increased competition for limited land
- Rural reconstruction projects remained limited to small areas for short periods

**[Instructor note: Emphasize that roughly 85 percent of Chinese still lived in rural areas. The Nationalist modernization largely bypassed them.]**

**Chiang's Political Philosophy:**
Chiang Kaishek was not a democrat. He admired aspects of fascism and launched the "New Life Movement" in 1934 to instill military discipline and Confucian values in the population. He sought to "militarize the life of the people of the entire nation" and create citizens "willing to sacrifice for the nation."

The press was heavily censored. Suspected communists were arrested and often executed. Dissent was not tolerated.

**Key Question:** The Nationalists built a modernizing but authoritarian state that served urban elites while neglecting the rural majority. Was this a viable path to national strength?

---

### Segment 2: Mao's Road—Revolution in the Countryside (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 19 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** While Chiang built his modern state, the shattered Communist Party was developing a very different vision in the mountains of south-central China.

**The Crisis of 1927:**
The Shanghai massacre and subsequent "White Terror" devastated the Communist Party. Membership plummeted from perhaps 60,000 to fewer than 10,000. Many leaders were killed; others fled abroad. The urban labor base was destroyed.

**Orthodox Marxism's Problem:**
According to Marxist theory, revolution should be led by the urban proletariat—factory workers. But China's proletariat was tiny and, after 1927, thoroughly suppressed. If the Communists stuck to orthodox theory, they had no path forward.

**Mao's Insight:**
Mao Zedong drew different conclusions. In his famous "Report on the Peasant Movement in Hunan" (1927), written before the Shanghai disaster, Mao had celebrated peasant radicalism:

*"In a very short time, several hundred million peasants will rise like a mighty storm... They will sweep all the imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry into their graves."*

After 1927, Mao translated this insight into strategy: if revolution couldn't be built in the cities, it would be built in the countryside.

**[Click slide: Mao in the late 1920s]**

**The Jiangxi Soviet:**
In 1929, Mao and military commander Zhu De established a base area in the remote mountains between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces. Over the next few years, they built what they called the "Jiangxi Soviet"—a revolutionary government controlling several million people.

**Land Revolution:**
In areas they controlled, the Communists implemented radical land reform:
- Land was confiscated from landlords and redistributed to poor peasants
- Debts were cancelled
- Rents were abolished or drastically reduced
- Village councils gave peasants a voice in local government

**[Click slide: Map showing Jiangxi Soviet territory]**

**Mao's study of Xunwu County (1930)** reveals his careful attention to rural conditions. He classified the population by landholding:
- Landlords (those who rented land to others)
- Rich peasants (who worked some land and rented some)
- Middle peasants (who farmed their own land)
- Poor peasants (who rented land from others)
- Landless laborers

This analysis allowed the Communists to identify who would benefit from revolution (poor peasants and laborers) and who would resist (landlords and rich peasants).

**Building the Red Army:**
The Communists also built a disciplined military force—the Red Army—recruited primarily from poor peasants. Unlike warlord armies that looted and abused civilians, Red Army soldiers were taught to:
- Pay for what they took from villagers
- Return doors and straw used for bedding
- Treat peasants with respect
- Explain the revolution's goals

This won crucial support in the countryside.

**Party vs. Mao:**
Mao's approach was not universally accepted within the party. The leadership in Shanghai, still following Comintern directives from Moscow, often overruled him. They insisted on conventional military tactics and urban insurrections—which repeatedly failed.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 31 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "Both the Nationalists and Communists claimed to represent China's future. Based on what we've discussed, whose vision do you think had more appeal to the majority of Chinese people? Why?"

[Allow brief pair discussion]

**Key insight:** The Nationalists offered modernization but primarily for urban elites. The Communists offered land to the peasant majority. In a country that was 85 percent rural, this difference would prove decisive.

---

### Segment 3: Encirclement, Escape, and the Long March (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 34 minutes into class]**

**The Extermination Campaigns:**
Chiang Kaishek was determined to destroy the Communist base areas before dealing with other threats—including Japan. From 1930 to 1934, he launched five "encirclement and extermination" campaigns against the Jiangxi Soviet.

The first four campaigns failed. Mao and Zhu De used guerrilla tactics—avoiding pitched battles, drawing enemies deep into unfamiliar territory, striking when they had local superiority, then melting away.

**The Fifth Campaign:**
The fifth campaign (1933-1934) was different. Chiang hired German military advisers who built a network of blockhouses and roads, slowly strangling the Soviet base. Meanwhile, Comintern advisers had convinced the party leadership to abandon guerrilla tactics for conventional positional warfare.

The results were catastrophic. By fall 1934, the Jiangxi Soviet was doomed.

**The Long March Begins:**
In October 1934, about 86,000 Communist soldiers and officials broke through Nationalist lines and began what would become known as the Long March—a desperate retreat in search of a new base area.

**[Click slide: Map showing Long March route]**

**The Journey:**
Over the next year, the survivors marched roughly 6,000 miles through some of China's most difficult terrain:
- Crossing major rivers under fire
- Climbing snow-covered mountain passes
- Traversing swamps where many drowned
- Constant pursuit by Nationalist forces
- Shortages of food, medicine, and ammunition

Of the 86,000 who began the march, only about 8,000 reached the destination.

**The Zunyi Conference:**
In January 1935, at the town of Zunyi in Guizhou province, party leaders held a crucial meeting. They blamed the military failures on the Comintern advisers' rigid tactics and gave Mao increased authority over military decisions.

Zunyi marked the beginning of Mao's rise to paramount leadership—a position he would consolidate over the next decade and hold until his death in 1976.

**Arrival in Yan'an:**
In October 1935, Mao's forces reached Yan'an in Shaanxi province, a remote area in China's northwest. There they would establish a new base area and rebuild the revolution.

**The Long March's Meaning:**
The Long March became foundational mythology for the Chinese Communist Party—a story of determination, sacrifice, and ultimate triumph against impossible odds. The survivors formed the core of the party leadership for the next fifty years.

But it was also a catastrophic defeat. The Communists lost more than 90 percent of their forces and abandoned all their base areas in the south.

### Segment 4: Yan'an—Building a New Society (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 44 minutes into class]**

**The Yan'an Model:**
In the remote caves of Yan'an, the Communists built something unprecedented: a model society that would serve as blueprint for the future People's Republic.

**Edgar Snow's Visit:**
In 1936, American journalist Edgar Snow became the first Western reporter to visit the Communist base area. His book *Red Star Over China* (1937) introduced Mao and the Chinese Communists to the world.

Snow found something unexpected: "committed patriots and egalitarian social reformers, full of optimism and purpose." The leaders lived simply, ate the same food as ordinary soldiers, and seemed genuinely committed to peasant welfare.

**[Click slide: Edgar Snow photograph of Mao at Yan'an]**

**Life in Yan'an:**
Yan'an life emphasized:
- Simple living (leaders lived in caves carved into hillsides)
- Collective labor (everyone, including intellectuals, did manual work)
- Political study (constant meetings, discussions, self-criticism)
- Guerrilla preparedness (military training for all)
- Cultural revolution (literacy campaigns, folk art with revolutionary themes)

**Mao as Thinker:**
It was at Yan'an that Mao developed his distinctive version of Marxism. In essays like "On Practice" and "On Contradiction," he argued that:
- Theory must emerge from and be tested by practice
- Chinese conditions required Chinese solutions, not imported formulas
- Peasants could be revolutionary agents if properly organized and led
- Armed struggle—"political power grows out of the barrel of a gun"—was necessary for revolution

**Tensions Within:**
Yan'an was not paradise. The party demanded rigid conformity. In 1942, a young intellectual named Wang Shiwei published essays titled "Wild Lilies" criticizing hierarchy and privilege within the party. He asked why leaders got special food and clothing while ordinary people suffered.

Wang was publicly denounced, imprisoned, and eventually executed. His fate illustrated the party's intolerance of internal dissent—a pattern that would intensify after 1949.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 52 minutes into class]**

**Quick Reflection:** "By 1937, the Communists had survived near-extinction and built a new base at Yan'an, but they controlled only a tiny, impoverished corner of China. The Nationalists controlled the cities, the coast, and most of the population. What would it take for the Communists to have any chance of winning?"

[Students reflect briefly]

**Foreshadowing:** The answer was about to arrive—in the form of Japanese invasion.

## CLOSING: The Calm Before the Storm (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
By 1937, China had two governments with two visions:
- The Nationalists offered modernization, but primarily for urban elites, while maintaining an authoritarian political system
- The Communists offered land reform and peasant empowerment, but at the cost of strict party discipline and intolerance of dissent

Neither controlled the whole country. The Nationalists had resources but faced rural indifference or hostility. The Communists had peasant support in limited areas but were militarily weak.

**Looking Forward:**
What changed everything was Japan. On July 7, 1937, a skirmish at Marco Polo Bridge near Beijing sparked full-scale war. Over the next eight years, Japan would occupy China's richest regions, kill millions of Chinese, and—ironically—give the Communist Party the opportunity to grow from a marginal guerrilla force into a mass movement capable of challenging for national power.

Next time, we examine the catastrophe of the Second Sino-Japanese War and how it transformed China's political landscape.
