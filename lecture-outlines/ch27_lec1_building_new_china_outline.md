# CHAPTER 27: CHINA UNDER MAO (1949-1976)
## Three-Lecture Series Overview

**Time Period:** 1949-1976

**Series Learning Objectives:**
1. Analyze how the Communist Party transformed Chinese society through land reform, collectivization, and political campaigns
2. Evaluate the costs and benefits of Maoist policies for different segments of Chinese society
3. Explain the causes and consequences of the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution
4. Assess Mao Zedong's legacy and the ongoing debates about his role in modern Chinese history

**Connection Between Lectures:**
This series traces the arc of Maoist China from revolutionary triumph through utopian disaster. Lecture 1 examines the early years of consolidation, social transformation, and the first hints of the destructive pattern to come. Lecture 2 follows the catastrophe of the Great Leap Forward—humanity's worst famine—and its political aftermath. Lecture 3 examines the Cultural Revolution, when Mao turned the party he had built against itself, and assesses the Maoist era as a whole.

**How This Complements the Textbook:**
While the textbook covers major policies and events, these lectures will emphasize the human experience of living under Mao—how ordinary people navigated political campaigns, how families were torn apart and sometimes reunited, and how the revolutionary promise of 1949 evolved into the trauma of the Cultural Revolution. We'll use personal accounts and memoirs to hear voices often silenced in official narratives.

### Lecture Theme

The Communist victory in 1949 was not an ending but a beginning. Within a few years, the new government had redistributed land to hundreds of millions of peasants, transformed the status of women, fought the world's most powerful military to a standstill in Korea, and begun building a socialist economy. Real improvements in health, education, and living standards gave the revolution genuine popular support. But these years also revealed darker patterns: the use of mass campaigns to mobilize—and terrorize—the population, the silencing of dissent, and Mao's growing impatience with anyone who stood between him and his vision of China's future.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow these transformations through multiple perspectives: a landlord facing "struggle sessions" during land reform, a young woman escaping an arranged marriage under the new Marriage Law, and an intellectual who believed Mao's invitation to "let a hundred flowers bloom"—only to be destroyed when the flowers were cut down. Their stories reveal both the revolution's genuine achievements and its capacity for destruction.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Assessing the Early PRC:** Scholars have long debated how to evaluate the early years of the People's Republic. Some emphasize genuine achievements: the near-elimination of illiteracy, dramatic improvements in public health, the liberation of women from patriarchal families, and the first sustained economic growth in China's modern history. Others focus on the violence of land reform (perhaps one to two million killed), the suppression of dissent, and the warning signs of future catastrophes. Recent scholarship, drawing on newly available archives and oral histories, has revealed a more complex picture: a regime that was simultaneously modernizing and terrorizing, liberating and controlling. We'll examine how ordinary Chinese experienced these contradictions.

## OPENING: The Day Everything Changed (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display photograph of Mao proclaiming PRC at Tiananmen, October 1, 1949

Begin with a moment of transformation:

On a spring morning in 1950, a work team from the Communist Party arrived in a village in Hunan province. They called all the villagers to a meeting in the temple courtyard. A young cadre stood up and announced: "The old society is finished. From today, the land belongs to those who work it."

**Opening Question:** "What would it mean for a peasant family who had rented land for generations to suddenly own it? What would it mean for the landlord who had owned that land?"

[Allow brief student responses]

**The Scope of Change:**
Over the next three years, the largest redistribution of property in human history would occur. Approximately 113 million acres of land would be taken from landlords and rich peasants and given to 300 million poor peasants. Nothing like this had ever happened before.

**Transition:** The land reform was just one part of a comprehensive transformation of Chinese society. Today we examine the first years of the People's Republic—the genuine achievements that gave the revolution popular support, and the violence and repression that accompanied them.

**Preview:** We'll trace the party's consolidation of power, the transformation of rural China through land reform, the revolution in family life, and the first major confrontation between the party and China's intellectuals.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Party Takes Power (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**The Challenge:**
When the Communists took power in 1949, China was devastated:
- Economy in shambles after decades of war
- Hyperinflation still spiraling
- Railroad tracks destroyed, bridges blown up, harbors clogged
- Millions of refugees displaced
- No functioning government in much of the country

The party had to build a state from scratch while simultaneously transforming society.

**Adopting the Soviet Model:**
The new government looked to the Soviet Union for guidance. In December 1949, Mao traveled to Moscow—his first trip abroad—and spent nine weeks negotiating with Stalin. He secured Soviet loans, technical assistance, and the promise of 10,000 Soviet advisers.

Over the next years, China adopted Soviet-style:
- Five-Year Plans for industrial development
- Collectivization of agriculture
- Central planning and state ownership of major enterprises
- Political structures (though adapted to Chinese conditions)

**[Click slide: Mao and Stalin photograph 1949]**

**The Political Structure:**
The Communist Party sat at the apex of all power. By the mid-1950s:
- More than 1 million party committees existed at every level
- The party controlled government, military, education, media
- Every workplace had a party cell
- Every citizen was embedded in a *danwei* (work unit) that controlled housing, rations, marriage permission, and travel

**The Danwei System:**
The *danwei* became the basic unit of Chinese urban life:
- Assigned housing, often in compounds with coworkers
- Provided ration coupons for food, cloth, and other necessities
- Required permission for marriage and divorce
- Kept political files (dang'an) on every individual
- Organized political study sessions

For better and worse, the state now reached into every aspect of life.

**Early Campaigns:**
The party consolidated power through mass campaigns:

- **Counterrevolutionary campaign (1950-1951):** Targeted former Nationalist officials, "spies," and "bandits." Estimates of those executed range from hundreds of thousands to several million.

- **Three-Anti and Five-Anti campaigns (1951-1952):** Targeted corruption, waste, and "bureaucratism" among officials; then targeted capitalists for bribery, tax evasion, and stealing state property. Businessmen were subjected to public denunciation meetings; many committed suicide.

**[Instructor note: These campaigns established patterns that would recur throughout the Mao era: mass mobilization, public denunciation, pressure to meet quotas for finding "enemies."]**

**The Korean War:**
The new government faced its first international crisis within a year. When U.S. forces approached the Chinese border in October 1950, Mao sent "volunteers" (actually regular army units) into Korea.

Over the next three years, China fought the United States to a stalemate:
- Perhaps 400,000 Chinese soldiers killed (including Mao's eldest son)
- War gave the party nationalist legitimacy—China had "stood up" against imperialism
- But war also intensified domestic repression and delayed economic recovery
- U.S.-China enmity would last for decades

### Segment 2: Land Reform—Revolution in the Village (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 17 minutes into class]**

**The Heart of the Revolution:**
Land reform was the revolution's core promise. For centuries, Chinese peasants had dreamed of owning the land they worked. Now that dream would become reality.

**The Process:**
Land reform unfolded in stages:

1. **Work teams arrive:** Party cadres and students came to villages to "cultivate relations with the poor."

2. **Classification:** Every family was classified as landlord, rich peasant, middle peasant, poor peasant, or hired laborer. These labels would follow families for generations.

3. **Speaking bitterness:** Poor peasants were encouraged to publicly describe their suffering under the old system—creating an emotional foundation for what came next.

4. **Struggle sessions:** Landlords and rich peasants were brought before village meetings, accused of crimes, forced to confess. The crowd shouted slogans; accusers might hit the accused.

5. **Redistribution:** Land, tools, animals, and sometimes houses were distributed to poor peasants.

**[Click slide: Land reform meeting photograph]**

**The Violence:**
Land reform was not a peaceful transfer of property. Party directives called for executing "tyrants" and "counter-revolutionaries" to break the power of the old elite.

How many died? Estimates range from one million to several million. In some villages, every landlord was killed. In others, violence was more limited. Much depended on local cadres' zeal.

**Personal Account:**
A witness recalled a struggle session in his village:

*"They brought old Chen to the front. He had been the biggest landlord—maybe 50 acres. People shouted at him, accused him of beating tenants, of letting people starve. Then a man whose father had died during a famine grabbed a stick and hit him. Others joined in. Chen fell down and didn't get up."*

**The Problem of Classification:**
Classification was supposedly scientific—based on land ownership and labor. But in practice, it was often arbitrary:
- What about a widow who rented out land because she couldn't farm it herself?
- What about a family that had bought land only recently?
- What about villages where no one was really wealthy?

Cadres faced pressure to find enough landlords to struggle against. The labels became hereditary: children of landlords remained "bad class" for decades.

**The Results:**
Land reform achieved its goals:
- 300 million peasants received land
- The landlord class was eliminated as a social and political force
- Peasants had compelling reasons to support the new government
- The party established its presence in every village

But it also:
- Killed perhaps one to two million people
- Created a caste system based on class labels
- Established "struggle sessions" as a political tool
- Showed that revolutionary violence could be directed against almost anyone

---

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "Land reform achieved something Chinese reformers had dreamed of for decades—giving land to those who worked it. But it also involved tremendous violence. How should we evaluate policies that achieve good ends through terrible means? Is this a false choice?"

[Allow brief pair discussion]

**Key insight:** This tension—between genuine achievements and terrible costs—runs throughout the Mao era. There are no easy answers.

---

### Segment 3: Transforming Family Life (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**The Marriage Law of 1950:**
One of the revolution's most significant early acts was the Marriage Law of May 1950, which:
- Abolished arranged marriage
- Established free choice of partners
- Granted women the right to divorce
- Outlawed concubinage and child betrothal
- Gave women equal rights to property

**Revolutionary Intent:**
The party saw the traditional family as a bastion of "feudal" oppression. The Marriage Law aimed to liberate women and break the power of patriarchal families.

**[Click slide: Marriage Law propaganda poster]**

**Real Impact:**
The law had real effects:
- In the first five years, several million marriages were dissolved, mostly at women's request
- Women who had been sold as child brides could now leave
- Young people could marry partners of their choice
- Women gained inheritance rights

**Biography: A Telephone Minder's Story**
Jin Shuyu, born in 1917 to an ethnic Korean family near the Manchurian border, lived through the revolution. After escaping an arranged marriage and years of hardship, she found her life transformed. In 1958, the party assigned her to mind the community telephone:

*"Jin's life in China was relatively uneventful. In 1958 she was given a job by her street committee to mind the community telephone... Jin's salary was very low, but she got half the fees people paid to make calls. Moreover, she enjoyed listening to people talk on the phone."*

Her story illustrates how the revolution brought modest but real improvements to ordinary lives.

**The Limits of Change:**
But transformation had limits:
- Male cadres often ignored the law or enforced it selectively
- Rural women faced enormous pressure not to disgrace their families
- Some women who sought divorces were beaten or killed by husbands and in-laws
- Traditional attitudes persisted despite legal changes

**[Instructor note: The Marriage Law illustrates a recurring pattern: revolutionary laws could change formal rules, but changing deeply rooted social practices was far harder.]**

**Other Social Changes:**
Beyond marriage, the revolution transformed daily life:
- Mass literacy campaigns taught millions to read
- Public health campaigns attacked opium addiction, prostitution, and epidemic diseases
- "Barefoot doctors" brought basic healthcare to villages
- Life expectancy began to rise dramatically

**Controlling the Population:**
But the same party that liberated women also controlled them:
- The *danwei* had to approve marriages and divorces
- By the late 1950s, the *hukou* (household registration) system restricted internal migration
- Political campaigns could target anyone, including women's rights advocates

### Segment 4: The Hundred Flowers and Anti-Rightist Campaign (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 42 minutes into class]**

**Background:**
By 1956, the party had consolidated power. The first Five-Year Plan was succeeding. China seemed stable.

But Mao was worried. He saw party cadres becoming bureaucratic, arrogant, distant from the masses. After Khrushchev's secret speech denouncing Stalin's crimes, Mao worried about similar criticisms emerging in China.

**"Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom":**
In 1956, Mao announced a new policy: "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." He invited intellectuals to criticize the party.

At first, few responded—they sensed a trap. But in spring 1957, after repeated encouragement, criticism poured forth:
- Students put up "big character posters" attacking party officials
- Professors criticized ideological interference in education
- Writers complained about censorship
- Some questioned one-party rule itself

**[Click slide: University wall covered in big character posters, 1957]**

**One Famous Poster:**
At Qinghua University in Beijing, a poster dared to attack Mao himself:

*"When he wants to kill you, he doesn't have to do it himself. He can mobilize your wife and children to denounce you and then kill you with their own hands! Is this a rational society?"*

**The Trap Springs:**
In June 1957, Mao announced that the "blooming and contending" had revealed "poisonous weeds" among the "fragrant flowers." The Anti-Rightist Campaign began.

Over the following months:
- Units were pressured to identify 5 percent of their members as "rightists"
- Approximately 550,000 to 700,000 people were labeled
- Rightists lost their jobs, were sent to labor camps, or were exiled to remote villages
- Many remained "rightists" for over twenty years

**Did Mao Plan This?**
Historians debate whether Mao always intended to entrap critics or was genuinely surprised by the criticism's intensity. Either interpretation is troubling:
- If planned, it was deliberate cruelty
- If reactive, it shows Mao's inability to tolerate dissent

**The Lesson Learned:**
After 1957, Chinese intellectuals learned that speaking honestly was dangerous. This silence would have catastrophic consequences during the Great Leap Forward, when no one dared tell Mao his policies were failing.

---

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 50 minutes into class]**

**Quick Reflection:** "The Anti-Rightist Campaign taught intellectuals that honest criticism was dangerous. What happens to a government when no one is willing to tell leaders that their policies are failing?"

[Students reflect briefly]

**Foreshadowing:** We'll see the answer in our next lecture, when Mao's Great Leap Forward created humanity's worst famine—in part because no one dared report the truth.

## CLOSING: The Revolution's Promise and Shadow (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
By 1957, the revolution had genuinely transformed China:
- Land reform had ended centuries of landlord power
- Women had gained legal rights unimaginable a decade earlier
- Literacy was spreading, health improving, industry growing
- China had fought the United States to a draw

But the revolution had also revealed its darker face:
- Mass campaigns that killed millions
- Classification systems that condemned people for their family background
- Thought control that silenced dissent
- A leader who could not tolerate criticism

**Looking Forward:**
What Mao did next would test the revolution's achievements against his radical vision. Convinced that human will could overcome any obstacle, he launched the Great Leap Forward—a campaign to transform China overnight into a communist utopia.

The result would be the greatest famine in human history.

Next time: The Great Leap Forward and its catastrophic consequences.
