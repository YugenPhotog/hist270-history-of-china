# LECTURE 1: Ming Founding and Consolidation

**50 minutes | Focus: How did Zhu Yuanzhang rise from poverty to found the Ming Dynasty, and what kind of state did he create?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
Zhu Yuanzhang started as a beggar monk whose family died in plague. He became China's emperor and ruled for thirty years, but he was so paranoid that he executed thousands of officials. How did extreme poverty and suspicion shape the Ming Dynasty?

### 2. **Yuan Collapse and Zhu Yuanzhang's Rise** (10 minutes):
- Yuan Dynasty (Mongol, 1271-1368) weakened by mid-14th century
- Floods, droughts, epidemics in 1340s
- Zhu Yuanzhang's family: rent collectors evicted them during drought
- Father, oldest brother, brother's wife died leaving three boys
- Zhu asked monastery to take him as novice, monastery short of funds sent him out to beg
- Traveled through central China for 3-4 years, returned when monastery could afford rent
- 1351: **Red Turbans rebellion** rose against Yuan (White Lotus Society, Manichaean millenarian beliefs)
- Zhu (age 24) joined rebels, rose quickly among them
- One commander married daughter to Zhu
- Within couple years, Zhu commanded 20,000-30,000 men
- **Strategy**: Gradually distanced himself from Red Turbans, attracted literati advisers
- Defeated rivals one after another (1356-1368)

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Partner Discussion: How might Zhu's experience of extreme poverty have shaped his views on government, officials, and the common people?

### 4. **Ming Taizu's Autocratic State** (12 minutes):
- Known as **Taizu** (r. 960-976) or "Hongwu Emperor"
- Word "ming" resonated with Manichaean ideology (means "bright, light")
- Retained Yuan practices: hereditary military service households, **hereditary service obligations for artisan households**
- **Key decisions to consolidate power**:
  - Retired and executed generals to prevent challenges
  - Assigned civil officials to supervise military (no army could threaten ruler again)
  - Made princes ineligible for examinations, sent to fiefs outside capital
  - Moved capital from Nanjing to Beijing (Yongle emperor, 1407-1420)
- **Deeply ambivalent about educated men**:
  - Suspicious but needed them to run government
  - Brutal humiliations in open court
  - Executed thousands for perceived criticism
  - 1376: Killed thousands allegedly involved in plot
  - 1380: Concluded chancellor Hu Weiyong plotting assassination; executed Hu and 15,000 associates
  - **Abolished position of chancellor**, dealt directly with department heads
  - From 1380 on: no buffer between emperor and government
- Tang legal code revised five times, legal experts ensured consistency
- Full-scale registration of cultivated land and population for tax assessment
- Issued instructions to villages on moral behavior, harmony, avoiding litigation

### 5. **Weaknesses Built Into System** (8 minutes):
- **Princes problem**: Taizu had 26 sons, feared they and descendants could cause trouble
- Sent them to live outside capital on government stipends
- Forbidden to take examinations, serve in office, follow any career
- They were supposed to be military assignments, but this never worked
- **Taizu's solution**: After death, eldest son or grandson inherits (primogeniture)
- **Inheritance result**: One mediocre emperor followed another
- Yingzong (1436-1450) led army against Mongols at age 8, led to his capture
- Xianzong (1465-1488) manipulated by favorite eunuch, allowed palace lady to have children by other men, killed systematically
- Wuzong (r. 1505-1521) defied established practices, spent much time drunk
- Shizong (r. 1522-1567) refused to hold court for years, allowed memorials to pile unopened
- **Hai Rui** (1516-1587) submitted memorial saying emperor had failed as man, father, ruler; emperor was so shocked he didn't execute Hai

### 6. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: Taizu designed a system where no one could threaten the emperor. What were the unintended consequences when the emperor himself wasn't competent?

### 7. **Early Ming Military Ventures** (7 minutes):
- Taizu wanted to recover territories Han Dynasty had held
- Hanoi area easily recovered 602, pushed further south
- **Yongle Emperor (1403-1424)** authorized expedition into Vietnam 1406
- Successful but held only two decades
- Vietnamese declared independence in 10th century (maintained thereafter)
- **Zheng He maritime expeditions** (1405-1433):
  - Seven voyages
  - Fleets of 300 seagoing ships, 27,000 sailors and soldiers
  - Traveled to Southeast Asia, India, Persian Gulf, East Africa
  - Brought back exotic animals (giraffes, lions)
  - **Purpose uncertain**: Display power? Trade? Diplomatic missions?
  - Expensive, no lasting return
  - After Yongle's death and patron's death (1424, 1433), voyages abandoned
  - Later, ships with three or more masts broken up, used for lumber

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
Taizu created a centralized autocratic state that could function without a strong emperor, but the system's rigidity created its own problems. Next lecture: How did the examination system expand, and what was its impact on society and culture?

**Big Question**: Was the Ming system of centralized control a strength or a weakness? What happens when you design a government around the assumption of a capable ruler?
