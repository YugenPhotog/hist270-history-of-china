# LECTURE 2: The Qing at Its Height

**50 minutes | Focus: How did Kangxi, Yongzheng, and Qianlong create the largest, most prosperous empire in Chinese history?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
The Kangxi Emperor wrote: "Giving life to people and killing people—those are the powers that an emperor has. He knows that administrative errors in government bureaus can be rectified, but that a criminal who is executed cannot be brought back to life." What kind of ruler agonized over such decisions?

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The three great emperors (Kangxi, Yongzheng, Qianlong) created an empire of unprecedented size and prosperity. But by 1800, population pressure, official corruption, and the challenge of maintaining Manchu identity in a vast Chinese empire would create new problems. Next lecture: We'll examine how Qing China dealt with internal challenges and encounters with European powers.

**Big Question**: How did the Qing balance their Manchu identity with the need to rule a predominantly Chinese empire? Was this balancing act sustainable?
