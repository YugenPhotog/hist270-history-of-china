# HIST 270: History of China
## Chapter 2, Lecture 2: Confucianism & Its Critics

**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Ritual order versus universal love  
**Header Color:** Gold (Cultural/philosophical content)

---

## Big Question
Is human nature good or bad? Can virtue govern?

---

## Lecture Structure

### 1. Hook (4 minutes)
"Confucius thinks he can fix chaos with... good manners?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- Start with seeming absurdity: ritual and etiquette during total war?
- This gets attention and sets up tension
- Frame as genuine puzzle: why would anyone think ritual could work?
- Preview: "Actually, there's profound logic here. Let's see if it makes sense."

---

### 2. Context: The Hundred Schools of Thought (5 minutes)

**Key Points:**
- Intellectual ferment 6th through 3rd centuries BCE
- Traveling philosophers (shi) offering advice to rulers
- "Hundred Schools" is later label (not used at the time)
  - Means "many schools" not literally 100
  - Later scholars categorized and organized these texts
- Schools means followers organizing texts after founder's death
  - Confucius wrote nothing; Analects compiled by disciples
  - Texts edited, expanded, debated for generations
- Today: focusing on 4 major responses to Warring States crisis

**Teaching Notes:**
- Students need to understand these are PRACTICAL advisors, not ivory tower academics
- Philosophers are competing for patronage
- Different philosophies offer different strategies for survival
- Texts are composite works, not single-author books
- This explains why texts sometimes contradict themselves

**Key Insight:**
Political crisis produces intellectual creativity. Compare to:
- Ancient Greece (city-states competing → philosophy)
- Renaissance Italy (city-states competing → humanism)
- Enlightenment (religious wars → new political theories)

### 3. Confucius (551-479 BCE) (15 minutes)

**Background (3 minutes):**
- Born in Lu state (eastern China)
- Minor aristocratic background
- Served briefly in government, failed to gain influence
- Spent years traveling, teaching disciples
- Died believing he had failed
- Disciples compiled his sayings into Analects

**Core Problem Confucius Addresses:**
"Social relationships have broken down. How do we restore order?"

**The Solution: Ren and Li (5 minutes):**

**Ren (humaneness, benevolence):**
- Inner virtue, concern for others
- Treating people with humanity
- Foundation of morality
- "Do not do unto others what you would not want done to you"

**Li (ritual propriety):**
- Outer behavior, proper conduct
- Following traditional rituals and customs
- Not just ceremonies - everyday behavior, manners, roles
- Expression of respect and social harmony

**Key Insight: Ren without Li is ineffective; Li without Ren is empty**

**Five Relationships (3 minutes):**
- Ruler and subject
- Father and son
- Husband and wife
- Elder brother and younger brother
- Friend and friend

**Structure:**
- Hierarchical BUT reciprocal
- Superior has obligations to inferior
- Inferior has obligations to superior
- Both bound by mutual duties
- **Filial piety (xiao)** is foundation - respect for parents

**Ruler as Moral Exemplar (2 minutes):**
- Lead by virtue, not force
- "If you lead by virtue and regulate through ritual, people will have a sense of shame and morality"
- Ruler's moral cultivation transforms society
- People naturally follow good example

**Education Transforms People (2 minutes):**
- Anyone can become a gentleman (junzi) through education
- "Gentleman" means person of moral cultivation, not aristocrat
- Study classics, practice rituals, cultivate virtue
- Contrast with "petty men" who seek only personal gain

**Key Teaching Point:**
- This is NOT primarily political theory
- This is ethical and social cultivation philosophy
- Government should work through moral influence, not coercion
- Assumes people respond to virtue

**Teaching Notes:**
- Students often misunderstand "ritual" as religious ceremony
- Emphasize: ritual means proper behavior in all situations (how you greet someone, how you serve tea, how you address elders)
- Modern equivalent: manners, etiquette, but much deeper - ritualized behavior as moral training
- Key debate: does this work during total war? Can virtue really govern?

### 4. Pause & Process #1 (3 minutes)

**Activity: Think-Pair-Share**

**Think (45 seconds):**
"Would Confucian virtue work when states are trying to annihilate each other? Could ritual and moral example really stop armies?"

**Pair (75 seconds):**
"Share your thoughts with a partner. Be honest."

**Share (60 seconds):**
- Call on 2-3 pairs
- Expected responses: "No, too idealistic", "Maybe if everyone agreed", "Seems unrealistic"
- Acknowledge skepticism: "Right! And guess what? Mozi thought the same thing."

**Teaching Notes:**
- Validate student skepticism
- Sets up Mozi as sympathetic critic
- Shows that ancient Chinese also debated this

---

### 5. Mozi (ca. 480-390 BCE) - The Critic (12 minutes)

**Background (2 minutes):**
- Came after Confucius, probably knew his teachings
- From common background (possibly craftsman)
- Direct challenge to Confucius
- Mohists became organized movement (unusual for time)
- Defended cities under attack (practiced what they preached)

**The Core Critique of Confucius (10 minutes):**

**Universal Love (jian ai) versus Hierarchical Love (4 minutes):**

**Confucius says:**
- Care for family first, then expand outward
- Different levels of obligation
- Filial piety is foundation

**Mozi says:**
- "Concern for everyone" equally
- No distinctions between family and strangers
- Impartial care for all people
- "If everyone loved others' families as their own, would there be warfare?"

**Key Debate:**
- Confucius: hierarchy is natural and necessary
- Mozi: hierarchy creates conflict and warfare

**Anti-War Stance (2 minutes):**
- Warfare is huge waste of resources
- Loss of life, destruction of crops
- Rulers glorify conquest but people suffer
- Mozi and followers literally defended besieged cities
- Practical, not pacifist: defense is justified

**Anti-Ritual Extravagance (2 minutes):**
- Confucian rituals are wasteful
- Example: three-year mourning period
  - Parents die, son stops working for three years
  - Hurts economy, weakens state
  - Is this really "filial"?
- Elaborate ceremonies drain resources
- Simple funerals are sufficient

**Merit Principle (2 minutes):**
- Promote the worthy and capable
- Not relatives or aristocrats
- Rulers should hire based on ability
- Utilitarian standard: **Does it benefit the people and the state?**
- This is the measure of right policy

**Major Intellectual Rivalry:**
- Confucians versus Mohists = huge debate in 4th-3rd centuries BCE
- Later: Confucianism wins, Mohism declines
- Why? (Preview for later discussion)

**Teaching Notes:**
- Mozi is sympathetic to modern students (egalitarian, anti-war, meritocratic)
- BUT his "universal love" seemed unnatural to Chinese (and most humans)
- Key question: Is it realistic to love strangers as much as family?
- Also: Mohists were organized, almost cult-like - made others suspicious
- Mozi's utilitarianism: good policy = what benefits people (measurable outcomes)

**Image Placeholder:**
- Mohist defensive siege equipment (they were famous for defense)
- Search terms: "Mohist siege defense ancient China", "Mozi defensive warfare"

### 6. Mencius (ca. 370-300 BCE) - The Defender (8 minutes)

**Background (1 minute):**
- Two generations after Confucius
- Explicitly defends Confucius against Mozi and others
- Book of Mencius (Mengzi) records conversations with rulers
- Tried to convince rulers to adopt benevolent government

**Core Argument: Human Nature Is Fundamentally Good (7 minutes):**

**The Baby in the Well (2 minutes):**
- Famous thought experiment
- "If you see a baby about to fall into a well, what do you do?"
- Answer: Everyone instinctively tries to save it
- NOT because you know the parents
- NOT for reward or reputation
- Because humans have innate moral sense

**Innate Morality (2 minutes):**
- Humans are born with "four sprouts" (beginnings of virtue)
  - Compassion (becomes benevolence/ren)
  - Shame (becomes righteousness)
  - Courtesy (becomes propriety/li)
  - Wisdom (becomes knowledge of right and wrong)
- These need proper cultivation through education
- But they're THERE from birth

**Proper Cultivation Through Education (1 minute):**
- Like tending plants - nurture what's already present
- Bad environment can corrupt good nature
- Good environment develops natural goodness
- Education brings out innate virtue

**Benevolent Government (2 minutes):**
- Rulers should cultivate their own virtue
- Benevolent government wins people's hearts
- "When granaries are full, people understand ritual and moderation"
- Economic welfare AND moral education
- Rulers who are cruel lose the Mandate of Heaven
  - This justifies rebellion against tyrants
  - Mencius more radical than Confucius here

**Key Insight:**
- Defends Confucian hierarchy (family love first is natural)
- Attacks Mozi's universal love (unnatural, impossible)
- Optimistic about human potential
- Government should nurture natural goodness

**Teaching Notes:**
- Mencius makes Confucianism more explicitly political
- "Benevolent government" becomes major Confucian political concept
- His view that rebellion against tyrants is justified = important precedent
- Question for students: Do YOU think humans are naturally good?

### 7. Xunzi (ca. 310-215 BCE) - The Realist (5 minutes)

**Background (1 minute):**
- Latest of the major Confucians we're discussing
- Still considered Confucian BUT controversial
- Two of his students became famous Legalists (!)
- This tells you he's different

**Core Argument: Human Nature Is Bad and Selfish (4 minutes):**

**Humans Are Born Selfish (2 minutes):**
- Natural desires: food, comfort, pleasure, sex
- Will fight over resources if unconstrained
- Aggression and selfishness are innate
- "If human nature were good, why would we need sages?"

**Education and Ritual Required to Correct Nature (2 minutes):**
- Ritual discipline TRANSFORMS bad nature into good behavior
- Not just expressing inner virtue (Confucius)
- Not just nurturing sprouts (Mencius)
- Ritual is CORRECTIVE training
- Repeated practice creates habits
- Habits create civilized people

**Emphasis on Ritual Discipline:**
- Strict adherence to li
- External behavior shapes internal character
- Music and ritual are educational technologies

**Influence on Legalism:**
- If humans are bad, maybe laws/punishments needed?
- Xunzi still believes education works
- But his students take darker view: only force works
- This leads to Legalism (next lecture)

**Key Insight:**
- Pessimistic about human nature
- But optimistic about education and culture
- Humans CAN be good, but require intensive training
- Less optimistic than Mencius, more realistic?

**Teaching Notes:**
- Xunzi is bridge to Legalism (next lecture)
- His view: humans need strong external constraints
- Question: which view fits your experience? Mencius (people naturally good) or Xunzi (people naturally selfish)?

---

### 8. Pause & Process #2 (3 minutes)

**Activity: Spectrum**

**Setup:**
"I'm going to ask you to position yourself on a spectrum from 'human nature is good' to 'human nature is bad.' Stand up and move to where you think you are."

**One end of room:** "Humans are naturally good (Mencius)"  
**Other end:** "Humans are naturally bad (Xunzi)"  
**Middle:** "Neutral or mixed"

**Debrief (90 seconds):**
- "Look around - we're divided, just like ancient China!"
- "Ask person near you: why did you stand there?"
- Quick share-out from different positions

**Teaching Notes:**
- Gets students moving (physical reset)
- Reveals diversity of opinion
- Shows these are REAL philosophical questions, not just ancient abstractions
- Validates multiple perspectives

---

### 9. Wrap-up (3 minutes)

**Synthesis:**
"So we have Confucius saying: restore order through ritual and virtue. Mozi saying: that's hierarchical nonsense, we need universal love and practical benefits. Mencius defending Confucius: humans ARE naturally good. Xunzi saying: no, humans are naturally bad, but we can train them."

**Big Question Answered:**
"Is human nature good or bad? Can virtue govern? Ancient China debated this intensely. No consensus. Different rulers adopted different philosophies."

**Preview Next Lecture:**
"Next time: even MORE radical alternatives. Daoists say: stop trying so hard, go with the flow. Legalists say: forget virtue, use force. Sunzi says: war is about deception. And we'll see which philosophy actually 'won' - spoiler: Legalism conquers China, but Confucianism wins the long game."

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't oversell Lecture 3
- Leave them with the unresolved debate
- Emphasize that these questions still matter today
