# LECTURE 1: Song Founding and Northern Rivals

**50 minutes | Focus: How did the Song Dynasty create stability while coexisting with powerful non-Chinese states?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
Zhao Kuangyin was put on the throne by his troops, but his first priority was making sure no army would ever do that again. How did the Song founder transform China from military rule to civilian bureaucratic control?

### 2. **From Five Dynasties to Song** (9 minutes):
- Late Tang collapse left China fragmented (907-960)
- Five Dynasties in north: warlords, often non-Chinese from old garrison armies
- Ten Kingdoms in south: fragmentation but economic prosperity
- 960: General Zhao Kuangyin's troops declare him emperor (Taizu)
- **Key decision**: Taizu rotated and retired generals, assigned civil officials to supervise military
- Subordinated armed forces to civil bureaucracy permanently
- Made peace with Khitan Liao to north, giving up reconquest attempts

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Think-Pair-Share: Taizu gave up territory to maintain peace. Was this weakness or wisdom? What were the trade-offs?

### 4. **The Khitan Liao State** (11 minutes):
- Proto-Mongol people from eastern Manchuria slopes
- **Abaoji united tribes 916-926**, secured control of steppe
- Established hereditary succession (breaking tribal tradition)
- Set up dual administration: nomadic tribal system AND Chinese bureaucracy
- **Conquered "Sixteen Prefectures"** including line of Great Wall fortifications
- Southern section governed as Chinese state: examinations, Chinese officials, even Chinese dynastic name "Liao"
- Northern section maintained nomadic culture
- **This cultural dualism was key innovation**
- Liao administered Chinese territories differently than Khitan territories
- Founded Southern Capital at modern Beijing

### 5. **Song-Liao Relations** (9 minutes):
- Early attempts to defeat Liao failed (Khitan horsemen superior)
- 1004: **Treaty of Shanyuan** after Liao invaded
  - Song paid 100,000 ounces silver, 200,000 bolts silk annually
  - In exchange: Liao maintained peace, recognized Song control of south
  - Payment increased to 500,000 units in 1042
- **Pro-war critics**: humiliated by paying tribute, expensive
- **Pro-peace accommodationists**: trade exceeded tribute cost (only 2-3 percent of revenues), arguing cost-effectiveness
- Northern Song prospered under peace despite loss of north

### 6. **The Tangut Xia State** (7 minutes):
- Founded by Tanguts (related to Tibetan) in northwest
- United tribes in 881, called Chinese court for help against Mongols
- Adopted script for Tangut language, dynasty name Xia
- 1044: **Treaty with Song** for payments similar to Liao arrangement (200,000 units)
- Xia recognized as sovereign state
- Song surrounded by equals: Liao, Xia, later Jin
- **Perennial tension**: imperial ideology versus military reality

### 7. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: Compare the Han Dynasty's approach to northern neighbors with the Song approach. What changed, and why?

### 8. **Wrap-up** (4 minutes):
The Song made a strategic choice: accept military limitations, pay for peace, focus on internal prosperity. Next lecture: We'll see how this choice enabled the "medieval Chinese economic revolution."

**Big Question**: Was the Song peace-through-payment strategy a sign of weakness or a sophisticated adaptation to new geopolitical realities?
