# LECTURE 3: Revolution Devours Its Children
## The Cultural Revolution and the Death of Mao (1966-1976)

**Total Lecture Time:** 50 minutes

---

### Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain Mao's motivations for launching the Cultural Revolution and why he targeted the Communist Party itself
2. Analyze the phases of the Cultural Revolution and the experiences of Red Guards, intellectuals, and sent-down youth
3. Evaluate the human cost and lasting impact of the Cultural Revolution on Chinese society
4. Assess Mao Zedong's historical legacy and the ongoing debates about his role in Chinese history

---

### Lecture Theme

The Cultural Revolution (1966-1976) was Mao's final and most destructive campaign—a revolution against the revolution itself. Convinced that "capitalist roaders" had infiltrated the party, Mao mobilized students to attack the very institutions he had built. Schools closed, millions were persecuted, and China descended into chaos. This lecture examines how the Cultural Revolution unfolded, what it meant for those who lived through it, and how we should assess the Maoist era as a whole.

---

### Central Story

We'll follow the Cultural Revolution through the eyes of those it swept up: idealistic Red Guards who believed they were saving the revolution, intellectuals like Liu Shaoqi who were destroyed by the movement they had helped build, and the "sent-down youth" who lost their education to years of rural exile. Their stories reveal both the seductive power of revolutionary idealism and its capacity for destruction.

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Assessing the Cultural Revolution:** Unlike the Great Leap Famine, the Cultural Revolution has been officially acknowledged in China—and officially condemned. The party's 1981 resolution described it as "responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses suffered by the Party, the country, and the people since the founding of the People's Republic." But this verdict coexists with continued reverence for Mao. Scholars debate how much to blame Mao personally versus the political system he created, and whether the Cultural Revolution represented Mao's ideology taken to its logical conclusion or its perversion. We'll examine these debates while focusing on the human experience.

### Structure Outline

## OPENING: The Little Red Book (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display image of Red Guards waving copies of *Quotations from Chairman Mao*

Begin with an image that captures the era:

In August 1966, a million young people gathered in Tiananmen Square. They waved little red books—*Quotations from Chairman Mao*—and chanted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long, long live Chairman Mao!"

When Mao appeared atop Tiananmen Gate, the crowd went wild. Young people wept with joy. They would have done anything for him.

And over the next few years, they did.

**Opening Question:** "What would make young people willing to denounce their teachers, beat their neighbors, and destroy their own country's cultural heritage—all in the name of revolution?"

[Allow brief student responses]

**The Paradox:**
The Cultural Revolution was launched by the party's chairman against the party itself. It mobilized young people to destroy institutions their parents had built. It was a revolution eating its own children.

**Transition:** Today we examine the Cultural Revolution—Mao's final campaign, launched to purify the revolution and preserve his legacy. Instead, it devastated a generation and left wounds that still haven't healed.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: Mao's Revenge (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**Mao's Position by 1965:**
After the Great Leap disaster, Mao had stepped back from day-to-day governance. Liu Shaoqi and Deng Xiaoping ran the party and economy, implementing pragmatic policies that abandoned Mao's radical vision.

Mao brooded. He saw betrayal everywhere:
- The party had become bureaucratic and distant from the masses
- "Capitalist roaders" were restoring inequality
- His own legacy was being quietly repudiated
- Soviet-style "revisionism" was taking over

**The Ideological Setup:**
By the early 1960s, Mao was elaborating a new theory:
- Class struggle continued even after socialism was established
- The bourgeoisie could regenerate within the party itself
- Only "continuous revolution" could prevent restoration of capitalism
- The youth—uncorrupted by pre-revolutionary habits—must lead this revolution

**[Click slide: Mao in 1966]**

**The Spark:**
In late 1965, Mao encouraged criticism of a historical play, *Hai Rui Dismissed from Office*, which could be read as allegorical criticism of Mao's treatment of Peng Dehuai. The attack on the play's author was the Cultural Revolution's opening shot.

**May 1966:**
On May 16, 1966, the party's Central Committee issued a circular calling for "cultural revolution" against "representatives of the bourgeoisie who have sneaked into the Party."

Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and her allies—later called the "Gang of Four"—formed a Cultural Revolution Small Group to direct the movement.

**Phase 1: The Red Guards (Summer-Fall 1966)**

The movement began at Beijing's elite middle schools and universities. Students organized themselves into "Red Guards" (*hongweibing*) to defend Chairman Mao against his enemies.

On August 18, 1966, Mao appeared at the first of eight mass rallies, donning a Red Guard armband. The message was clear: youth had his blessing.

**What the Red Guards Did:**
- Attacked teachers and school administrators
- Destroyed "Four Olds": old customs, old culture, old habits, old ideas
- Ransacked homes, destroyed art, burned books
- Beat people publicly—sometimes to death
- Changed street names, shop names, personal names to revolutionary alternatives

**The Violence:**
The "Red August" of 1966 saw horrific violence:
- In Beijing alone, nearly 2,000 people were beaten to death
- Tens of thousands of homes were raided
- Millions of cultural artifacts were destroyed
- People with "bad class backgrounds" were expelled from cities

**The Cult of Mao:**
The cult of Mao reached extreme heights:
- *Quotations from Chairman Mao* was printed in hundreds of millions of copies
- Mao's portrait and sayings appeared everywhere
- Morning rituals involved bowing to Mao and reciting quotations
- Any disrespect—even accidentally damaging a newspaper with Mao's photo—could bring severe punishment

### Segment 2: Targeting the Party (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 17 minutes into class]**

**The Real Targets:**
As 1966 continued, the Cultural Revolution's real purpose became clear: attacking Mao's rivals within the party.

**Liu Shaoqi's Fall:**
Liu Shaoqi, president of the People's Republic and Mao's designated successor, was the principal target:
- Denounced as "China's Khrushchev" and "the number one capitalist roader"
- Subjected to mass denunciation rallies
- Beaten by Red Guards who invaded his home
- Stripped of all positions
- Denied medical care as his health failed
- Died alone in 1969, his body cremated under a false name

Liu's wife was imprisoned for over a decade. His children were persecuted.

**[Click slide: Denunciation rally—victim in dunce cap]**

**Deng Xiaoping:**
Deng Xiaoping, the party's general secretary, was also purged:
- Labeled "the number two capitalist roader"
- Sent to work in a tractor factory in Jiangxi province
- His son, Deng Pufang, was thrown from a window by Red Guards and paralyzed for life

**The Pattern of Denunciation:**
Struggle sessions followed a script:
- Accused wore dunce caps and signs listing their crimes
- Crowds shouted slogans and accusations
- Victims were forced into painful postures (the "airplane position"—bent forward with arms pulled up behind)
- Physical violence was common
- Victims were required to confess and implicate others

**The Suicide Epidemic:**
Many chose death over continued humiliation:
- Lao She, one of China's greatest writers, drowned himself after being beaten
- Wu Han, author of the play that sparked the Cultural Revolution, died in prison
- Countless lesser-known figures took their own lives

**Phase 2: Chaos (1967-1968)**

By 1967, the movement had spiraled beyond control:
- Red Guard factions fought each other with weapons
- Workers formed revolutionary organizations
- Armed battles broke out between rival groups
- The military was drawn in to restore order
- Foreign embassies were attacked (the British embassy was burned)

**"Revolutionary Committees":**
The old party and government structures were replaced by "Revolutionary Committees" that combined military officers, party cadres, and "mass representatives."

The military became the dominant force, though always in Mao's name.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "The Cultural Revolution began with idealistic young people trying to defend the revolution. It ended with millions persecuted and the country in chaos. How did revolutionary idealism produce such destruction? What does this suggest about mass movements?"

[Allow brief pair discussion]

**Key insight:** The Cultural Revolution shows how easily the desire to purify and perfect can become the impulse to destroy.

---

### Segment 3: The Sent-Down Youth (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Phase 3: Stabilization and Exile (1968-1976)**

By mid-1968, the chaos had to end. Mao called on the army to restore order and disbanded the Red Guard organizations.

But what to do with millions of young people whose schooling had been interrupted?

**"Up to the Mountains and Down to the Villages":**
From 1968 to 1976, approximately 17 million urban young people were "sent down" to rural areas to "learn from the peasants."

In theory, this was revolutionary education. In practice, it was exile.

**The Experience:**
Sent-down youth (*zhiqing*) experienced:
- Backbreaking agricultural labor they were unprepared for
- Primitive living conditions
- Separation from families, sometimes for years
- Hostility from peasants who didn't want them
- Loss of educational opportunities
- In some cases, abuse and exploitation

**Personal Account:**
A former sent-down youth recalled:

*"We arrived in the village full of revolutionary enthusiasm. Within weeks, we were just exhausted and hungry. The peasants didn't want us—we couldn't do the work properly, and we were extra mouths to feed. I spent seven years there. Those were supposed to be my university years."*

**The "Lost Generation":**
The sent-down youth became known as the "lost generation":
- Their formal education was cut short or eliminated entirely
- Many spent their best years doing agricultural work
- Psychological scars persisted for decades
- Yet some found meaning in the experience and formed lasting bonds

**Lin Biao's Fall (1971):**
The Cultural Revolution's most dramatic reversal came in September 1971. Lin Biao, the Defense Minister who had compiled *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and been designated Mao's successor, died when his plane crashed in Mongolia—allegedly while fleeing after a failed coup attempt.

The official story was never fully explained. Lin, who had been praised more effusively than anyone except Mao, was suddenly declared a traitor.

The Lin Biao affair shattered many people's faith in the Cultural Revolution. If Lin—Mao's "closest comrade-in-arms"—was a traitor, what did that say about the whole movement?

**Slow Decline (1972-1976):**
The Cultural Revolution's final years saw:
- Gradual return of pragmatists like Deng Xiaoping
- Opening to the United States (Nixon's visit in 1972)
- Continued factional struggle between radicals and moderates
- Mao's declining health and increasing detachment

### Segment 4: The Death of Mao and His Legacy (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 42 minutes into class]**

**1976: The Year of Deaths:**
1976 was a year of earthquakes, both literal and political:
- January: Premier Zhou Enlai died; public mourning was suppressed
- April: Tiananmen incident—crowds gathered to mourn Zhou; the demonstration was crushed
- July: Massive earthquake in Tangshan killed hundreds of thousands
- September 9: Mao Zedong died

**[Click slide: Mourning for Mao, September 1976]**

**The Gang of Four:**
Within a month of Mao's death, his radical allies—the "Gang of Four" including Jiang Qing—were arrested by military and party leaders. They became scapegoats for the Cultural Revolution's excesses.

**Assessing Mao:**
The party's 1981 resolution on history declared:
- The Cultural Revolution was "responsible for the most severe setback and the heaviest losses" since 1949
- Mao was a "great Marxist" whose contributions outweighed his errors
- His errors were "the errors of a great proletarian revolutionary"
- The verdict: "70 percent good, 30 percent bad"

**The Costs of the Cultural Revolution:**
Estimates of the Cultural Revolution's human toll vary:
- Deaths from violence: perhaps 1-2 million
- Those persecuted: tens of millions
- Those sent to countryside: approximately 17 million
- Cultural destruction: incalculable

Nearly 3 million people were officially "rehabilitated" after 1978—meaning they had been wrongly persecuted.

**The Lasting Impact:**
The Cultural Revolution left deep marks on Chinese society:

**Social:**
- Trust was shattered; people had informed on family members and friends
- Traditional culture was damaged but not destroyed
- Education was disrupted for a generation

**Political:**
- The party survived but lost much of its ideological legitimacy
- "Never again" became the implicit lesson
- Deng Xiaoping's reforms explicitly rejected Cultural Revolution radicalism

**Personal:**
- Trauma for millions who participated, suffered, or both
- Many former Red Guards later expressed regret and sought reconciliation
- The experience shaped reform-era leaders' worldviews

**Mao Today:**
Mao's legacy remains contested:
- His portrait still hangs over Tiananmen
- His body lies in a mausoleum in the square
- The party maintains the "70/30" verdict
- But critical assessment is largely forbidden
- Popular nostalgia coexists with traumatic memories

**International Comparison:**
Mao has often been compared to Stalin and Hitler. Like Stalin, he presided over famines and purges. Unlike Hitler, he fought against fascism and imperialism. His regime was revolutionary where Hitler's was reactionary.

Yet Mao's death toll—from famine, purges, and political violence—may exceed Stalin's and rivals Hitler's.

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 52 minutes into class]**

**Final Reflection:** "Mao Zedong unified China after a century of division, liberated millions of peasants, and raised living standards for many. He also presided over the deaths of tens of millions and decades of political terror. How should history judge such a figure?"

[Students reflect briefly]

## CLOSING: The Revolution's Arc (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis—The Mao Era:**
From 1949 to 1976, China experienced:
- Genuine liberation for many—land reform, women's rights, education
- Terrible suffering—land reform violence, the Great Leap Famine, the Cultural Revolution
- Constant political campaigns that kept the population in fear
- A personality cult that subordinated everything to one man's vision

**The Final Balance:**
By 1976, China was:
- Unified and independent for the first time in over a century
- Diplomatically recognized by most of the world
- Nuclear-armed and militarily powerful
- More literate and longer-lived than in 1949

But also:
- Economically far behind neighbors who had started at similar levels
- Traumatized by decades of political campaigns
- Distrustful, exhausted, ready for change

**Looking Forward:**
Mao's death opened the door for Deng Xiaoping and the reform era. Within a few years, China would begin the transformation that has made it an economic superpower.

But the reform era would not repudiate Mao entirely. His portrait still watches over Tiananmen Square, a symbol of both liberation and tragedy, revolution and destruction.

**Closing Thought:**
In 1981, Deng Xiaoping was asked how history would judge Mao. He reportedly replied: "Mao was a great man who transformed China. But he made serious mistakes. We must not use his mistakes to deny his greatness, nor use his greatness to deny his mistakes."

Whether that balance is sustainable—or possible—remains China's great unresolved question.

## SERIES CONCLUSION

With this lecture, we complete our examination of China under Mao. The three lectures have traced an arc from revolutionary triumph through utopian catastrophe to final exhaustion:

- **Lecture 1:** The revolution's genuine achievements and its violence—land reform, women's liberation, but also terror campaigns
- **Lecture 2:** The Great Leap Forward—ideology overriding reality, humanity's worst famine
- **Lecture 3:** The Cultural Revolution—the revolution turning on itself, leaving trauma that still shapes China

The Mao era ended in 1976, but its legacy continues. The party that Mao built still rules China. The trauma of those years still shapes Chinese politics—both the government's fear of instability and citizens' wariness of political campaigns.

Understanding the Mao era is essential for understanding contemporary China: its achievements, its anxieties, and its ongoing struggle to come to terms with its revolutionary past.
