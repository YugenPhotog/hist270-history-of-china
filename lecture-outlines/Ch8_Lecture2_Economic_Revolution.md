# LECTURE 2: The Medieval Chinese Economic Revolution

**50 minutes | Focus: How did Song China become the most economically advanced society in the world?**

## Structure:

### 1. **Hook** (4 minutes):
By 1100, China had 100 million people, paper money, iron production of 125,000 tons per year, and cities with over a million residents. Europe wouldn't reach these levels for centuries. What transformed the Chinese economy?

### 2. **Agricultural Expansion** (10 minutes):
- Population possibly doubled from mid-Tang to 1100 (50 million to 100 million)
- **Wet-field rice cultivation** spread through central and south China
- Rice provides more calories per acre than wheat or millet
- Double-cropping became common: rice in south, commercial crops everywhere
- Farmers grew sugar, oranges, cotton, silk, tea for market (not just subsistence)
- Milder temperatures in south allowed two crops on same plot
- Rivers and streams facilitated shipping (regional specialization)
- **Result**: Denser settlement, more towns, more markets

### 3. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1** (3 minutes):
Partner Discussion: When farmers produce for markets instead of just for themselves, what changes in society? Think about occupations, towns, and trade.

### 4. **Commercial Revolution** (12 minutes):
- With abandonment of equal-field system, land buying and selling returned
- Poor sold land to rich, creating great estates
- More goods meant more trade, more merchants
- **Merchants became progressively more specialized and organized**:
  - Set up partnerships and joint-stock companies
  - Separated owners (shareholders) from managers
  - Organized into guilds by product type
  - Periodically set prices, arranged wholesale sales
- Government dealt with guild heads for requisitions and taxes
- **Money innovations**:
  - 1085: currency output 10 times Tang levels (over 6 billion coins per year)
  - Coins too heavy for large transactions
  - Local merchants used notes of exchange (transferred between deposit shops)
  - 1120s: **World's first government-issued paper money**

### 5. **Industrial Advances** (8 minutes):
- **Iron production**: 125,000 tons per year by 1078 (sixfold increase from 800 CE)
- Initially used charcoal, later switched to coke (bituminous coal)
- Mass-production methods for military goods: swords, armor in standard sizes
- Quality steel through high-temperature metallurgy
- Huge bellows powered by water wheels
- Army needed gunpowder (experimented with military applications)
- **Papermaking flourished**: books, documents, money, wrapping paper
- Heavy industry led to deforestation in parts of north

### 6. **Urban Growth** (7 minutes):
- Two capitals: Kaifeng and Hangzhou both exceeded 1 million residents
- Kaifeng at mouth of Grand Canal, became leading north China city
- Cities broke from Tang's walled-ward system, grew more organically
- Entertainment quarters: fortunetellers, acrobats, storytellers, tea houses
- Restaurants, brokers, catering companies, printing industry
- Markets open day and night (curfew abolished 1063)
- Knick-knack peddler image: woman with children buying toys from itinerant seller

### 7. **⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2** (3 minutes):
Quick Write: Marco Polo was astounded by Chinese cities in the 1270s. Based on what we've discussed, what specific things would have amazed a European visitor?

### 8. **Wrap-up** (3 minutes):
The Song economic transformation created unprecedented prosperity and a more commercialized society. Next lecture: How did the expansion of the examination system create a new scholar-official class to govern this complex economy?

**Big Question**: Why did the Chinese "economic revolution" of the Song period not lead to an "industrial revolution" as happened in Europe centuries later?
