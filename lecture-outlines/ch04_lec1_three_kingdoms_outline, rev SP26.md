# HIST 270: History of China
## Chapter 4, Lecture 1: When the Center Cannot Hold — The Three Kingdoms and the Collapse of Unity (184–316 CE)

**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Political fragmentation, military transformation, and elite withdrawal  
**Header Color:** Vermillion (Political chapter)

## Big Question
What happens when a 400-year empire collapses? Why couldn't anyone put it back together?

**Thesis (one sentence):**
The late Han did not simply “fall”—it **devolved into militarized regional states** competing over food, manpower, and legitimacy, and even reunification under the Western Jin proved fragile because the institutions and elite power arrangements that emerged during war were hard to reverse.

## Series Overview: The Period of Division

This three-lecture series covers one of Chinese history’s most transformative eras: a prolonged breakdown of unity that reshaped politics, identity, and religion. The collapse of the Han and the centuries that followed altered what it meant to be “Chinese,” especially once the north and south began living in different political worlds.

**Lecture Arc:**
1. **Lecture 1 (This lecture):** Political collapse, the Three Kingdoms, and the Western Jin failure  
2. **Lecture 2:** Non-Chinese rule in the north and the problem of identity  
3. **Lecture 3:** Buddhism’s expansion and religious transformation

**How This Complements the Textbook:**
The textbook covers extensive political detail across multiple regimes. These lectures instead emphasize:
- The *human experience* of collapse (refugees, trauma, elite withdrawal)
- The *cultural problem* of identity when “outsiders” rule the traditional heartland
- The *religious/intellectual opening* that helped Buddhism spread

---

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Explain why the Han collapse was not quickly reversible.
2. Identify the Three Kingdoms states and describe why they stalemated.
3. Describe key institutional/military changes (garrison farming, hereditary military households, non-Han recruitment).
4. Explain why Western Jin reunification failed (elite power struggles + civil war).
5. Connect political chaos to elite cultural responses (Nine Ranks, Seven Sages, xuanxue).

## Lecture Roadmap

### 1. Hook: "Romance vs. Reality" (5 minutes)

**Open with surprise:**
“How many of you have played *Dynasty Warriors* or watched a Three Kingdoms show? This era became one of the most mythologized periods in Chinese culture… but the lived reality was closer to apocalypse than heroism.”

**Show contrast:**
- Popular image: noble loyalty, brilliant stratagems, heroic warriors
- Historical reality: civil war, famine, epidemic disease, mass displacement, administrative collapse  
  - Note: even “population” figures we cite are usually **registered population** (state capacity), not perfect headcounts.

**Key statistic (carefully framed):**
- Late Western Han registers give a figure around **59.6 million** (2 CE). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}  
- Early Western Jin registers (after reunification) list about **16.16 million registered persons** in 280. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  
- Stress: the magnitude signals collapse in security and registration; it’s not a neat demographic measurement.

**Setup the problem:**
“Today we ask: Why couldn’t anyone rebuild the Han? And what happens to a civilization when serving government becomes so dangerous that educated elites start walking away from politics?”

**Teaching Notes:**
- Keep it fast: 1 minute pop-culture reference, 2 minutes contrast, 2 minutes “why it matters.”
- Promise students we’ll return to the *Romance* later as literature (and propaganda), not as a primary source.

### 2. The Han Collapse: A Perfect Storm (10 minutes)

**Key narrative: How 400 years of stability unraveled in a generation**

**A. The Yellow Turban Rebellion (184 CE)**
- Not just a “peasant revolt”—a *religious* uprising
- The Way of Great Peace (Taiping Dao): Daoist-inspired millenarian movement
- Slogan: “The Blue Heaven is dead; the Yellow Heaven shall rise”
- Large-scale coordinated violence across regions

**B. The Fatal Response**
- The Han court authorizes generals and local elites to raise armies to suppress rebellion
- Temporary decentralization becomes permanent: once armed power goes local, it’s hard to re-centralize

**C. The 189–190 Court Crisis (reworded for accuracy)**
- 189: court coup spirals into violence; eunuchs are massacred in the capital amid factional fighting
- Dong Zhuo enters with troops, seizes control of the court and emperor (legitimacy becomes a hostage)
- 190: the coalition against Dong Zhuo fractures; civil war and warlord rivalries become the new normal
- Luoyang is devastated; the court is moved; the symbolic center loses credibility

**D. Cao Cao as the “state-builder under catastrophe” (anchor by early 200s)**
- By the early 3rd century, Cao Cao dominates much of the north through superior organization:
  - control of grain supplies
  - strategic alliances / co-optation of elites
  - administration that can still extract resources amid chaos

**Discussion prompt (brief):**
“We saw the Qin collapse after 15 years, but the Han lasted centuries. What makes Han collapse harder to recover from?”
- Expected: scale, entrenched elites, administrative complexity, deeper civil war
- Guide toward: once military and fiscal extraction decentralize, rebuilding is brutally hard

**Teaching Notes:**
- Emphasize Yellow Turbans’ religious meaning (not only economics)
- Make Dong Zhuo a hinge: “the court is no longer a governing institution; it’s a prize”
- Keep Cao Cao as “institutional competence,” not hero/villain

---

### 3. ⏸ Pause & Process #1: Collapse Comparison (5 minutes)

**Prompt (slide):**  
“Compare the fall of the Han to the fall of the Roman Empire: what seems similar, and what seems different?”

**Structure:**
- 2 minutes: partner discussion
- 1 minute: quick whole-class share (2–3 responses)
- 2 minutes: instructor synthesis

**Expected comparisons:**
- Similarities: frontier peoples, military decentralization, economic stress, epidemics, civil war
- Differences: China eventually reunifies; Western Europe doesn’t reunify in the same way
- Geography and administrative traditions matter

**Why this works:**
It connects new material to familiar mental furniture and plants the seed we’ll revisit across the three lectures: **why did China reunify (eventually) when Europe fragmented for so long?**

**Teaching Notes:**
- If students don’t know Rome well: treat “Rome” as shorthand for “a huge empire that fractures.”

### 4. The Three Kingdoms: Not What You Think (12 minutes)

**Frame: Popular culture vs. historical reality**

**A. Periodization (tight and clear)**
- Breakdown phase: 184–220 (rebellion → warlords → end of Han)
- **Three Kingdoms proper: 220–280** (Wei, Shu-Han, Wu) :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}  
  - Shu falls (263)
  - Wei is replaced by Jin (266)
  - Wu falls (280) → reunification

**B. The Three States (use a simple map)**
- **Wei** (north): founded after 220; strongest resource base; controls the north China plain
- **Wu** (southeast): lower Yangzi; naval and riverine strength
- **Shu-Han** (southwest): Sichuan basin; defensible geography; claims “Han legitimacy”

**Key question for students:**
“Notice something? None of these states could quickly conquer the others. Why?”

**C. Why stalemate happens (give them a 3-part answer)**
1. **Geography**: Sichuan is hard to invade; the Yangzi is both highway and moat
2. **Logistics**: moving grain and siege capacity is harder than moving troops
3. **Institution-building**: each regime becomes *just strong enough* to survive

**D. Military Transformation (keep your three pillars, tighten details)**
1) **Cavalry revolution**
   - Stirrups become securely attested in early 4th-century contexts (Jin era), and cavalry effectiveness accelerates. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}  
   - Teach it as: “this era sets the conditions for heavier cavalry warfare” rather than “stirrup invented exactly in 300.”
2) **Military households**
   - Permanent soldier families (hereditary military status)
   - Families farm assigned land, state extracts rent/service → creates a durable military caste
3) **Incorporation of non-Chinese troops**
   - Steppe and frontier peoples are recruited into armies and sometimes settled in strategic zones
   - This is not “foreign invasion out of nowhere”—it’s an integration story that can flip

**E. Romance vs. reality (2 minutes, not 10)**
- Acknowledge the legend: Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu, Liu Bei, loyalty narratives
- Then land the punchline:
  - Romance: moral drama of heroes
  - Reality: resource exhaustion, devastated agriculture, political violence

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don’t drown in battle chronology. Make the unit about *why unity is structurally difficult.*
- The military household + non-Han recruitment point is your bridge into Lecture 2.

### 5. The Western Jin: Reunification’s False Dawn (8 minutes)

**A. Reunification (quick)**
- Jin replaces Wei (266), conquers Wu (280) → formal reunification of “China proper” :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}  

**B. Why reunification is fragile**
- Reunification is a military achievement; governance requires stable succession and elite coordination
- The Jin court relies heavily on princes and great families—high risk for factional warfare

**C. The War of the Eight Princes (291–306)**
- Civil war among Jin princes shatters state capacity
- Armies become tools of court factions; regions militarize further

**D. Opening the door**
- When the ruling house fights itself, frontier regimes and regional strongmen gain space to act
- (This is the setup for the next century’s northern political transformations)

**Teaching Notes:**
- Make this causal: “internal civil war → administrative breakdown → outside regimes expand.”
- Keep names minimal; emphasize mechanism.

### 6. ⏸ Pause & Process #2: Elite Response to Chaos (5 minutes)

**Prompt (slide):**
“If you were an educated elite family in 300 CE, would you:
A) pursue office and influence, or  
B) withdraw into private life and culture?”

**Structure:**
- 2 minutes: small group choice + reason
- 2 minutes: share 2–3 reasons from each side
- 1 minute: instructor synthesis

**Instructor synthesis:**
- Withdrawal isn’t just laziness: it can be survival strategy, critique, or status performance
- But it also reshapes culture: art, calligraphy, philosophy become new arenas of competition

---

### 7. When the Educated Give Up: Cultural Responses to Chaos (8 minutes)

**Frame: What happens when government service becomes too dangerous—or too corrupt—to be worth it?**

**A. The Nine Rank System (what it was, what it became)**
- Intended to identify talent and rank candidates for office
- In practice, it becomes a system where local evaluation + reputation networks empower great families
- Outcome:
  - office access tilts toward birth and connections
  - political participation becomes risky with low payoff unless you’re already elite

**B. The Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove**
- Group of intellectuals remembered for wine, poetry, music, and provocation
- “Study of the Mysterious” (xuanxue): engagement with Laozi/Zhuangzi themes (spontaneity, naturalness, critique of artificial norms)
- Use them as symbol of an elite mood: “If the state is insane, live truthfully.”

**C. Wang Xizhi (if you want a tangible cultural artifact)**
- Calligraphy as elite competition + self-cultivation
- “Civilization continues through style even when the state fails.”

**Discussion Questions (choose 1–2):**
1. Why might elites reject Confucian propriety during political chaos?
2. Is withdrawal an ethical critique, a privilege, or both?
3. Does culture become escapism—or a substitute arena for power?

**Teaching Notes:**
- Keep it grounded: withdrawal depends on networks and resources
- Make the bridge explicit: elite culture + identity questions explode in Lecture 2

---

### 8. Closing: The Refugee Generation (2 minutes)

**Close on the human note:**
- The chaos produces mass displacement; the south becomes a refuge and a new cultural center
- Avoid hard percentages unless you have a preferred citation—say:
  - “A very large share of court elites and many lineages relocate or re-root in the south, carrying texts, genealogies, and status claims.”

**Preview for Lecture 2:**
“But what about those who stayed in the north—and what does it mean to be ‘Chinese’ when the traditional heartland is ruled by regimes that aren’t Han?”

**Teaching Notes:**
- End with weight and a question; don’t resolve it yet

## Suggested Readings for Instructor (brief annotated bibliography)

### Core synthesis (best “prep anchors”)
1. **The Cambridge History of China, Vol. 2: The Six Dynasties, 220–589**
   - Best high-level scholarly synthesis; especially strong for institutions and the meaning of “registered population” figures like **16.16 million in 280**. :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}  
2. **Mark Edward Lewis, _China Between Empires: The Northern and Southern Dynasties_ (2009)**
   - Clear structural story: state formation, elite culture, and why division mattered long-term.
3. **Albert E. Dien, _Six Dynasties Civilization_ (2007)**
   - Great for elite life, culture, and “what it felt like,” without losing scholarly discipline.

### Three Kingdoms / Cao Cao
4. **Rafe de Crespigny, _Imperial Warlord: A Biography of Cao Cao_ (2010)**
   - The best single English biography for grounding Cao Cao as administrator + strategist under extreme conditions.

### Military systems (for your “military transformation” section)
5. **David A. Graff, _Medieval Chinese Warfare, 300–900_**
   - Use selectively: gives the long arc of warfare change that begins around the late 3rd/early 4th century.

### Southward shift / bridge to Lecture 2
6. **Andrew Chittick, _The Jiankang Empire in Chinese and World History_ (2020)**
   - Excellent for understanding why the south becomes a lasting political-cultural center (not just “refuge”).

### Articles (targeted “deepeners”)
7. **Scott Pearce, “Status, Labor, and Law: Special Service Households…” (1991)**
   - Strong for explaining hereditary service systems and why they matter.
8. **Howard Goodman, “Cao Pi and the Conflict of Wei Legitimacy” (1998)**
   - Great for legitimacy culture: how “replacement dynasties” argue they are rightful.

## Assessment Ideas (kept, lightly polished)

**Formative (in-class):**
- Pause & Process activities (Rome comparison; elite choice) as informal checks
- Cold-call: “Give one logistical reason conquest was hard.”

**Summative options:**
- Short answer:
  - “Explain how the Han response to the Yellow Turban crisis encouraged permanent fragmentation.”
- Essay:
  - “Why did reunification after the Han take longer than reunification after the Qin?”
- Document/culture analysis:
  - Provide a short passage on elite withdrawal (or an image of Seven Sages); ask students to interpret what it suggests about politics and values.
