# HIST 270: History of China
## Chapter 4, Lecture 2: Conquerors and the Question of Identity — Non-Chinese Rule in the North (316–580 CE)

**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Focus:** Ethnic complexity, sinification debates, and the Northern Wei transformation  
**Header Color:** Vermillion (Political chapter with cultural dimensions)

---

## Big Question
When "barbarians" rule China, who gets to define what "Chinese" means?

---

## Connection to Lecture Arc

**Previously (Lecture 1):** We saw how the Han collapsed, the Three Kingdoms fought to stalemate, and the brief Jin reunification ended in catastrophe. By 316 CE, non-Chinese peoples controlled the north.

**This lecture:** Explores the nearly three centuries when various non-Chinese dynasties ruled northern China—and how this transformed both the conquerors AND Chinese identity itself.

**Next (Lecture 3):** How Buddhism—another "foreign" import—conquered Chinese hearts and minds during this same period.

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:
1. Identify the major non-Chinese groups (Xiongnu, Xianbei, Jie, Di, Qiang) who ruled northern China
2. Analyze the debate over "sinification" vs. cultural hybridity
3. Explain Emperor Xiaowen's radical sinification program and its consequences
4. Evaluate how the Period of Division complicated what it meant to be "Chinese"

## Lecture Roadmap

### 1. Hook: "Who Counts as Chinese?" (5 minutes)

**Open with provocation:**
"Here's a question that sounds simple but isn't: Who counts as Chinese? Is it about ancestry? Language? Culture? Where you live?"

**Modern context (brief):**
"This question still matters today—debates about ethnic minorities, about Taiwan, about overseas Chinese identity. But the question was asked most urgently during the Period of Division, when people who the Han Chinese had called 'barbarians' for centuries were suddenly their rulers."

**Historical setup:**
"After 316, north China was ruled by a series of non-Chinese dynasties for nearly 300 years. The Chinese elite who remained had to figure out: Can we serve these rulers? Are they legitimate? What does our identity mean now?"

**Key framing:**
"Today we explore the most ethnically complex period in Chinese history—and discover that the answer to 'What is Chinese?' was never simple."

**Teaching Notes:**
- The modern relevance is real but don't overplay it—this is about historical understanding
- Students may have assumptions about Chinese ethnic homogeneity; this lecture complicates that
- "Barbarian" in quotes throughout—this is Chinese terminology, not objective description

---

### 2. Who Were the "Barbarians"? (10 minutes)

**Frame: These weren't a single group—they were diverse peoples with different histories**

**A. The Xiongnu Legacy**
- Remember them from Han Dynasty (our heqin policy discussion)
- After their confederation collapsed, many groups settled *inside* China
- By 300 CE: Xiongnu had lived in border regions for generations
- Some spoke Chinese, knew Chinese classics, used Chinese names
- "Liu Yuan, who captured Luoyang in 311, claimed descent from the Han imperial family through a marriage treaty. His dynasty was called 'Han'!"

**B. The "Five Barbarian" Groups**
Brief overview of complexity:
1. **Xiongnu** — Steppe people, longest Chinese contact
2. **Xianbei** — Northern nomads, would become dominant
3. **Jie** — "The most threatening"—described as looking distinctly different; brutal slave raids
4. **Di** — Northwestern peoples, some agricultural
5. **Qiang** — Western peoples, pastoral and agricultural

**Important point:** "These weren't racial categories—they were political and cultural identities that shifted over time. A 'Xiongnu' family might become 'Xianbei' through political alliance."

**C. Population Demographics**
The numbers changed everything:
- In some regions, non-Chinese outnumbered Chinese
- "One Chinese writer claimed that around Chang'an, the Chinese had become the minority"
- But in most of the north, Chinese still formed the demographic majority—even under non-Chinese rule

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't try to have students memorize all five groups—focus on Xiongnu (continuity) and Xianbei (dominance)
- The "Jie" persecution case shows ethnic violence went both ways
- Challenge any assumption that conquest was simple "barbarians vs. civilization"

---

### 3. The Sixteen Kingdoms: An Era of Violence (8 minutes)

**Frame: The chaos between Jin collapse and Northern Wei consolidation**

**A. Political Fragmentation (316–439 CE)**
- The name "Sixteen Kingdoms" is traditional but misleading—there were more
- Dynasties rose and fell quickly; average reign very short
- Violence was endemic: cities sacked, populations massacred or enslaved

**B. Shi Le: A Case Study in Complexity**
One of the most fascinating figures of the era:
- Born Jie tribesman; sold into slavery as a young man
- Rose to lead mounted bandits, then armies
- Conquered much of north China; founded Later Zhao dynasty (319–351)
- Could not read Chinese, but employed Chinese advisors
- Patronized Buddhism (we'll see why this mattered next lecture)

**Quote from textbook:**
"Shi Le had been sold into slavery by a Jin official. After gaining his freedom, he led a group of mounted brigands made up of escaped slaves and others at the margins of society."

**C. Ethnic Violence**
The Shi Le case reveals brutal ethnic dynamics:
- His successor (adopted son) launched persecution of ethnic Chinese
- "Called for the slaughter of non-Chinese, which his Chinese subjects carried out with a vengeance"
- Violence flowed in multiple directions based on who held power

**D. Liu Yuan-Shi Le Pattern**
- Both non-Chinese rulers employed Chinese officials
- Both needed Chinese administrative expertise to govern
- Both faced the question: How Chinese should we become?

**Teaching Notes:**
- Don't glorify or demonize—show the era's genuine brutality without othering
- Shi Le's literacy point is significant: he governed without reading Chinese himself
- The mutual dependence (rulers needing administrators, administrators needing patrons) is key

### 4. ⏸ Pause & Process #1: The Legitimacy Problem (5 minutes)

**Activity: Scenario Analysis**

**Display scenario on slide:**
"Imagine you are a Chinese scholar-official whose family has served the government for generations. Non-Chinese conquerors now rule your region. They offer you an administrative position. Do you accept?"

**Consider:**
- What do you gain? What do you lose?
- What do your ancestors' teachings say about serving a "barbarian" ruler?
- Does it matter if the ruler adopts Chinese customs?

**Process:**
- 2 minutes: Individual reflection (encourage writing)
- 2 minutes: Partner discussion
- 1 minute: Quick share—poll class on their choice

**Expected responses:**
- Accept: pragmatic survival, opportunity to preserve Chinese culture, rulers may become more Chinese through our influence
- Refuse: betrayal of civilization, ancestors would disapprove, collaboration with invaders
- Both positions have historical support

**Teaching Notes:**
- This was a REAL dilemma—thousands of families faced it
- Some families fled south; some stayed and served; some resisted
- The "refuse" choice often meant death or poverty—raise the stakes

---

### 5. The Northern Wei: A Different Approach (12 minutes)

**Frame: What happens when conquerors decide to transform systematically**

**A. Xianbei Unification (386–439 CE)**
- The Tuoba clan of the Xianbei created the most durable northern dynasty
- Founded Northern Wei in 386 from base in northern Shanxi
- Advantage: access to steppe cavalry AND Chinese agricultural population
- By 439: unified all of north China; would rule until 534

**B. Early Northern Wei: Separation Model**
For the first century, the Tuoba kept Chinese and Xianbei separate:
- Capital at Pingcheng (northern Shanxi)—closer to the steppe
- Xianbei warriors settled nearby as herders, not farmers
- "The army remained a north Asian preserve, with Chinese usually playing only support roles"
- Chinese ran the bureaucracy; Xianbei ran the military

**Why separation?**
- Fear of being "overwhelmed" by more numerous Chinese
- Military effectiveness depended on cavalry skills maintained through pastoral life
- Identity preservation: remain Xianbei, not become Chinese

**C. Emperor Xiaowen's Revolution (r. 471–499)**
Everything changed under one remarkable ruler:

**Background:**
- Born to a Chinese mother (Empress Dowager Feng was key influence)
- Wanted to unite Chinese and Xianbei elites
- Decided separation was unsustainable

**The Radical Program (493–499 CE):**
1. **Moved the capital** south from Pingcheng to Luoyang (old Han/Jin capital)
   - 300 miles closer to Chinese heartland
   - 150,000 Xianbei warriors moved south to fill Luoyang's guard ranks
   
2. **Banned Xianbei language and clothes at court**
   - Officials under age 30 must speak Chinese
   - "He banned the wearing of Xianbei clothes at court"
   
3. **Encouraged intermarriage**
   - Between highest-ranking Xianbei and Chinese families
   - "The highest-ranking families of the Chinese and Xianbei elites"
   
4. **Changed Xianbei surnames to Chinese ones**
   - The imperial house itself took the name "Yuan" (meaning "primal")
   - Made non-Chinese names sound less foreign

5. **Adopted Chinese government structures**
   - Equal-field system to redistribute land
   - Chinese-style bureaucratic ranks

**Quote illustrating the transformation:**
"So many southerners had been welcomed at Luoyang that there was a district known as the Wu quarter, where more than three thousand families lived, complete with their own fish and turtle market."

**Teaching Notes:**
- Xiaowen is one of the most significant figures in Chinese history—yet often overlooked
- His program was controversial AMONG Xianbei—many resisted
- Use Empress Dowager Feng to note women's political influence in this era

### 6. ⏸ Pause & Process #2: Sinification Debate (5 minutes)

**Activity: Mini-Debate Setup**

**Display two positions:**

**Position A:** "Sinification was a triumph of Chinese civilization. It shows the power of Chinese culture to absorb and transform conquerors."

**Position B:** "Sinification is the wrong word. What happened was *hybridization*—both Chinese and non-Chinese cultures were transformed."

**Instructions:**
- Raise your hand for Position A or Position B
- With a partner who chose the same position, list one piece of evidence from today's lecture
- Then: partner with someone from the opposite position—try to understand their argument

**Teaching Notes:**
- This is a genuine historiographical debate, not a settled question
- Position B reflects more recent scholarship
- Neither position is "wrong"—help students see the complexity
- Some students may note that "Chinese culture" itself was already diverse

---

### 7. The Hybrid Reality (8 minutes)

**Frame: Despite Xiaowen's program, the result was more complex than "becoming Chinese"**

**A. Xianbei Culture Didn't Disappear**
- Language persisted in private/family contexts
- Military culture retained steppe elements
- Hunting and martial skills remained elite markers
- Buddhism appealed to both Xianbei and Chinese (preview of Lecture 3)

**B. Chinese Culture Was Also Transformed**
- Northern Chinese adopted elements of steppe culture
- Cavalry warfare became central (not peripheral as in Han)
- Sitting on chairs (not mats) spread during this period—possibly Central Asian influence
- Diet, clothing, music all showed hybrid influences

**C. Gao Huan: The Perfect Hybrid**
Brief case study:
- Han Chinese by ancestry, but raised among Xianbei
- Married into a Xianbei family
- Could appeal to both ethnic communities
- "Because of his dual background, he could appeal to both Chinese and Xianbei"
- His speech to each group: "The Han are your slaves... The Xianbei are your retainers"
- Both statements partially true; both communities needed each other

**D. The Divisional Militia (Fubing)**
- Created in the northwest where Xianbei and Chinese were most mixed
- Multiethnic military system
- Soldiers registered separately from regular taxpayers—honorable status
- "Such registration carried honorable status"
- This system would later help reunify China under Sui/Tang

**Teaching Notes:**
- Gao Huan's speech shows remarkable political manipulation of ethnic tension
- The fubing system is key—it will appear again in Tang lectures
- Challenge simple narratives: this wasn't "Chinese win" or "Xianbei win"

---

### 8. The Southern Perspective: Refugees and Aristocrats (5 minutes)

**Frame: What happened to the Chinese who fled south?**

**A. The Eastern Jin at Nanjing (317–420 CE)**
- Refugee government established by surviving Jin prince
- Nanjing (then called Jiankang) became cultural capital
- "Reminiscent of the Western and Eastern Zhou and the Western and Eastern Han"

**B. Elite Culture in the South**
- Great families maintained genealogies obsessively
- "Married only within families of equivalent pedigree"
- Nine Rank System guaranteed elite status
- "They sit with foolish looks and widely-opened mouths as if sitting in a cloud or fog"—critique of southern aristocrats

**C. The Military Problem**
- Southern dynasties couldn't control their own generals
- Generals repeatedly seized power; four dynasties in two centuries (Song, Qi, Liang, Chen)
- Military households became near-slaves
- "Generals sometimes resorted to campaigns against the southern non-Chinese to capture men and make them into soldiers"

**D. North-South Contrast**
| Northern Dynasties | Southern Dynasties |
|---|---|
| Non-Chinese military elite | Chinese refugee aristocracy |
| Hybrid culture emerging | "Pure" Chinese culture claimed |
| More unified (Northern Wei) | Constant dynastic change |
| Buddhist-Confucian-Daoist mix | Buddhist flourishing + aristocratic culture |

**Teaching Notes:**
- South is covered briefly here—students should understand the contrast
- The "purity" claim of southern elites is ironic given their military weakness
- Set up the question: which model would eventually succeed in reunification?

---

### 9. Closing: Who Won the Identity War? (2 minutes)

**Synthesis:**

"By 580 CE, north China had been ruled by non-Chinese dynasties for over 250 years. But something remarkable had happened: the lines between 'Chinese' and 'non-Chinese' had blurred beyond recognition."

**Key takeaways:**
- The Xianbei who conquered were themselves transformed
- The Chinese who remained in the north incorporated steppe influences
- New hybrid elites emerged who could operate in both worlds
- And both north AND south would soon be reunified by a dynasty emerging from this hybrid northwest: the Sui (581)

**The answer to our opening question:**
"Who counts as Chinese? The Period of Division showed that Chinese identity was never simply about blood or birth. It was about culture, language, values—and these could be adopted, adapted, and transformed. The 'conquest' dynasties didn't destroy Chinese civilization. They became part of it."

**Preview for Lecture 3:**
"But there was one more transformation still to discuss—the most important one. Next time: How did Buddhism, an Indian religion that contradicted Confucian values in almost every way, conquer China even as 'barbarian' armies were conquering its territory?"

**Teaching Notes:**
- End with the historiographical point: "Chinese" is a process, not a fixed identity
- The Sui/Tang preview shows these centuries mattered for what came next
- Leave students with the complexity, not a simple resolution

- Comparative essay: "Compare how the Northern Wei and the Southern Dynasties dealt with questions of ethnic and cultural identity."
- Document analysis: Provide Gao Huan's speech to both communities; analyze his political strategy.
- Reflection: "How did the Period of Division change what it meant to be 'Chinese'? Use at least two specific examples."
