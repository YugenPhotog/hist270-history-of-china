**Duration:** 50 minutes  
**Slides:** ~27-30 slides  
**Header Color:** Vermillion (political chapter)  
**Date Range:** 1861–1900

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this lecture, students will be able to:

1. Explain the Self-Strengthening Movement's goals, methods, and limitations
2. Analyze why the Hundred Days Reform failed and Cixi's role in its suppression
3. Compare Chinese and Japanese responses to Western pressure and evaluate explanations for different outcomes

---

## Big Question

**"China tried to modernize—arsenals, shipyards, schools, even constitutional reform. Why did it fail where Japan succeeded? The answer reveals deep questions about institutions, culture, and political will."**

---

## Historiographical Note

This lecture explicitly engages the "why not China?" question that has preoccupied historians for generations. Multiple frameworks will be introduced: modernization theory, world-systems approaches, institutional explanations, and cultural arguments. Students should understand that different frameworks yield different answers—and different politics.

### TITLE SLIDE (Slide 1)
**[0:00–1:00] 1 minute**

**Content:**
- HIST 270: History of China
- Chapter 18, Lecture 3
- "Self-Strengthening and Its Discontents: Reform, Failure, and the Japan Comparison"
- Date Range: 1861–1900

**Presenter Notes:**
- Welcome students; this concludes our Chapter 18 unit
- Remind them: Boxer Rebellion video provides context for 1900 crisis
- Today's focus: the forty-year struggle over HOW to reform
- Big question: Why did China fail where Japan succeeded?
- This question has haunted Chinese thinkers for over a century

---

### HOOK: TWO MODERNIZERS (Slides 2-3)
**[1:00–7:00] 6 minutes**

#### Slide 2: Two Photographs
**Content:**
- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: "Li Hongzhang photograph 1870s statesman" (left side)
- IMAGE PLACEHOLDER: "Ito Hirobumi Japan photograph 1880s" (right side)
- Caption: "Two men who tried to modernize their countries. One succeeded. One failed. Why?"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Let images sit side by side—both men look serious, dignified, powerful
- Li Hongzhang (1823-1901): most powerful Chinese official for 30 years
- Itō Hirobumi (1841-1909): Japan's first Prime Minister, four-time PM, architect of Meiji constitution
- Both faced same challenge: respond to Western pressure
- Both were practical men who studied Western systems
- Their countries took radically different trajectories
- This lecture asks: What explains the difference?

#### Slide 3: The Question That Haunted China
**Content:**
- "Why are the Western nations small yet strong, while China is large yet weak?"
  — Feng Guifen, 1861
- This question drove 40 years of reform efforts
- Three phases of response:
  1. **Self-Strengthening** (1861-1895): Technology only
  2. **Hundred Days Reform** (1898): Institutions and politics
  3. **After 1900:** Everything must change
- **Today's lecture:** Phases 1 and 2

**Presenter Notes:**
- Feng Guifen's question became central to Chinese intellectual life
- His answer (in 1861): adopt Western technology while preserving Chinese essence
- This formula proved inadequate—but it took decades to learn that
- Preview the three phases; today focuses on first two
- Boxer Rebellion (Phase 3 setup) covered in their video
- The Japan comparison runs throughout

---

### SECTION 1: SELF-STRENGTHENING — THE FIRST ATTEMPT (Slides 4-11)
**[7:00–23:00] 16 minutes**

#### Slide 4: Section Header
**Content:**
- "Self-Strengthening: Technology Without Transformation"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: The Taiping Rebellion showed China's weakness; now what?
- The Self-Strengthening Movement was the elite response
- Key figures: Feng Guifen (theorist), Zeng Guofan, Li Hongzhang (practitioners)
- Their formula: "Chinese learning for the essence, Western learning for practical use"

#### Slide 5: The Self-Strengthening Formula
**Content:**
- **"Zhongti Xiyong"** (中體西用):
  - "Chinese learning for the essence"
  - "Western learning for practical use"
- Meaning: Keep Confucian values, political system, social order
- Add: Western weapons, ships, factories, languages
- **Assumption:** You can adopt technology without changing culture or institutions

**Popup Term: Zhongti Xiyong (中體西用)**
- "Chinese essence, Western use" — formula for selective modernization
- "Ti" (體) = essence, substance, foundation
- "Yong" (用) = use, function, application
- Implied hierarchy: Chinese civilization fundamentally superior
- Adopted Western technology as tools, not as model for society
- Compare to Japan's "Wakon Yōsai" (Japanese spirit, Western learning)—but Japan went much further

**Presenter Notes:**
- This formula sounds reasonable—many modernizing countries tried similar approaches
- The question: Can you really separate technology from the institutions that produce it?
- Can you have arsenals without changing education? Factories without changing labor relations?
- Self-Strengthening tested this hypothesis for 30 years
- Spoiler: the answer was no

#### Slide 6: What They Built
**Content:**
- **Military industries:**
  - Jiangnan Arsenal, Shanghai (1865) — largest in East Asia
  - Fuzhou Navy Yard (1866) — built steamships
  - Tianjin Arsenal, Nanjing Arsenal, others
- **Supporting institutions:**
  - Tongwenguan (interpreters' college, Beijing, 1862)
  - Translation bureaus — rendering Western texts into Chinese
  - Foreign language schools
- **Infrastructure:**
  - Telegraph lines (1880s)
  - First railway experiments

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Jiangnan Arsenal Shanghai 19th century factory"
- Search: "Jiangnan Arsenal Shanghai 1870s" or "江南制造局"
- Sources: Shanghai Municipal Archives, historical photographs

**Presenter Notes:**
- These were genuine achievements—not nothing
- Jiangnan Arsenal employed thousands, produced rifles, cannons, ammunition
- Fuzhou Navy Yard actually built modern warships (with French help initially)
- Translation bureaus produced hundreds of Western works in Chinese
- But note: everything is MILITARY focused
- Compare to Japan: Meiji reforms touched education, law, land, taxation, everything

#### Slide 7: Li Hongzhang's Projects
**Content:**
- **Timeline of Li Hongzhang's Self-Strengthening initiatives:**
  - 1862: Created gun factories with British/German instructors
  - 1863: Foreign language school in Shanghai
  - 1865: Jiangnan Arsenal (joint project with Zeng)
  - 1872: China Merchants' Steam Navigation Company
  - 1876-1881: Kaiping coal mines
  - 1880: Beiyang Fleet founded
  - 1885: Military academy in Tianjin
- Li dominated Self-Strengthening for 30 years

**Popup Term: Beiyang Fleet (北洋艦隊)**
- Northern Fleet built by Li Hongzhang in 1880s
- Largest and most modern Chinese naval force
- Included German-built battleships
- Intended to defend northern coast
- Destroyed by Japan in Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)
- Its defeat marked Self-Strengthening's failure

**Presenter Notes:**
- Li was tireless, pragmatic, and powerful
- Notice: almost all projects are in his sphere of influence (north China, Zhili province)
- Other provinces had similar projects but smaller scale
- The pattern: regional, not national; competitive, not coordinated
- Each governor protected his own turf
- No central planning, no national strategy

#### Slide 8: The Limits of Self-Strengthening
**Content:**
- **Structural problems:**
  - Provincial, not national (each governor had own projects)
  - Underfunded (relied on provincial taxes, customs revenue)
  - Conservative opposition ("Why learn from barbarians?")
  - No institutional reform (examination system unchanged)
- **The test: Sino-French War (1884-1885)**
  - France attacked over Vietnam
  - Fuzhou fleet destroyed in under an hour
  - China ceded Vietnam but kept some face
  - Verdict: Mixed results, serious weaknesses exposed

**Presenter Notes:**
- Sino-French War was a wake-up call that was partly ignored
- Fuzhou Navy Yard's fleet—years of work—gone in one battle
- But China didn't lose catastrophically, so urgency faded
- Conservative official Woren's famous attack: "Mathematics cannot make a nation strong"
- Even modernizers like Zeng Guofan were conflicted about how far to go
- The examination system continued testing classical knowledge, not modern subjects

#### Slide 9: Conservative Resistance
**Content:**
- **Why did conservatives oppose reform?**
  - Ideological: Confucian civilization is superior; copying "barbarians" is humiliating
  - Economic: Reform threatened existing interests (examination graduates, banner stipends)
  - Political: Strengthening military strengthened regional governors
- **Woren's objection (1867):**
  - "Anyone who could use mathematics to raise a nation from decline has never existed"
  - Hiring Westerners to teach was degrading
- **Result:** Reforms always contested, never comprehensive

**Presenter Notes:**
- Don't dismiss conservatives as stupid—they had coherent worldview
- They were also protecting real interests: jobs, status, power
- If examination system changed, what happened to everyone who'd invested years mastering classics?
- If military modernized under Han generals, what happened to Manchu banner officers?
- Reform threatened too many people with too much to lose
- Compare to Japan: Meiji reformers ELIMINATED the samurai class (their own class)—unthinkable in Qing China

#### Slide 10: The Cixi Factor — Part 1
**Content:**
- **Empress Dowager Cixi's position:**
  - Supported Self-Strengthening—in moderation
  - Needed strong military to maintain her power
  - Depended on Li Hongzhang and other modernizers
  - BUT: Also needed conservatives to balance them
- **Her strategy: Play factions against each other**
- She wasn't against reform—she was against reform that threatened HER

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Empress Dowager Cixi photograph throne room"
- Search: "Empress Dowager Cixi official portrait" or "慈禧太后 photograph"
- Sources: Freer Gallery Smithsonian, Palace Museum Beijing

**Presenter Notes:**
- Cixi is often portrayed as villain who blocked reform—more complicated
- She gave Li Hongzhang enormous latitude for 30 years
- She approved arsenals, shipyards, navy, foreign language schools
- But she also cultivated conservative allies
- Her goal: BALANCE—no faction strong enough to threaten her
- This made sense for her survival but prevented coordinated national reform
- Compare to Japan: oligarchs disagreed but could implement unified policy

#### Slide 11: Why Technology Wasn't Enough
**Content:**
- **The core problem:**
  - Modern weapons require modern factories
  - Modern factories require trained workers
  - Training requires modern education
  - Modern education requires changing the examination system
  - Changing examinations means changing who has power
- **Self-Strengthening tried to stop at step 2**
- You cannot modernize piece by piece—everything is connected

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is the key analytical point for students
- Draw on board or show diagram: each reform implies the next
- Japan understood this and reformed everything at once (messy, but comprehensive)
- China tried to compartmentalize: modern military, traditional everything else
- It didn't work—you can't have 19th-century army with 17th-century education
- This insight will drive the more radical reformers of the 1890s

### ⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (Slide 12)
**[23:00–27:00] 4 minutes**

#### Slide 12: Pause & Process — Can You Borrow Selectively?
**Content:**
- **Think-Pair-Share (3 minutes):**
- "Self-Strengthening tried to adopt Western technology without Western institutions."
- "Can you separate technology from the social systems that produce it?"
- "Think of a modern example: Can a country adopt smartphones without changing how people communicate, work, or relate to government?"
- Discuss with a neighbor

**Presenter Notes:**
- **Purpose:** Help students see why "just adopt technology" is harder than it sounds
- **What you're doing:**
  1. 90 seconds individual reflection
  2. 90 seconds pair discussion
  3. Cold-call 2-3 pairs
- **Expected responses:**
  - Technology changes behavior whether you want it to or not
  - Social media example: you can't control how people use it
  - Resistance to technology often about resisting social change it brings
- **Key insight:** Technology is never neutral; it reshapes society
- **Transition:** "In the 1890s, younger reformers drew exactly this conclusion—and proposed radical change."

### SECTION 2: THE HUNDRED DAYS AND CIXI'S COUP (Slides 13-19)
**[27:00–41:00] 14 minutes**

#### Slide 13: Section Header
**Content:**
- "The Hundred Days: Radical Reform and Its Destruction"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: Self-Strengthening's limits became undeniable in 1895
- A new generation of reformers emerged with more radical ideas
- They got their chance—and lost it in 103 days

#### Slide 14: The Sino-Japanese War Shock (1894-1895)
**Content:**
- **The ultimate humiliation:** China lost to Japan
  - A country Chinese had always considered culturally inferior
  - Japan was smaller, poorer, had modernized only since 1868
- **Battle of the Yalu River:** Beiyang Fleet destroyed
- **Treaty of Shimonoseki (1895):**
  - Taiwan ceded to Japan
  - Huge indemnity
  - Korea becomes Japanese sphere
  - Japan can build factories in China
- **The verdict: Self-Strengthening failed**

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Battle of Yalu River 1894 naval painting"
- Search: "Battle of Yalu River 1894 Sino-Japanese War"
- Sources: Naval museums, historical illustrations

**Presenter Notes:**
- This was psychologically devastating—Japan had learned from China for centuries
- Now Japan defeated China in every battle
- Li Hongzhang's Beiyang Fleet—his life's work—destroyed
- The treaty was humiliating but the psychological impact was worse
- Young intellectuals asked: If thirty years of Self-Strengthening led to THIS, what must we do differently?
- The answer: reform everything, not just technology

#### Slide 15: Kang Youwei's Radical Vision
**Content:**
- **Kang Youwei** (1858-1927):
  - Confucian scholar from Guangdong
  - Reinterpreted Confucius as a REFORMER, not conservative
  - Argued: China needs constitutional monarchy, parliament, modern schools
- **Liang Qichao** (1873-1929):
  - Kang's brilliant student
  - Journalist, wrote accessibly for broader audience
- **1895-1897:** Reform societies, newspapers, study groups flourish

**Popup Term: Kang Youwei's Confucianism**
- Radical reinterpretation: Confucius was a reformer whose teachings were corrupted
- The "true" Confucius wanted change and progress
- This allowed reform to be framed as return to origins, not Westernization
- Controversial: many scholars rejected Kang's interpretations
- Strategy: make reform acceptable within Chinese tradition

**Presenter Notes:**
- Kang was audacious—he essentially rewrote Confucianism to support reform
- His argument: the classics we have are corrupted; the "real" Confucius wanted change
- This was intellectually creative but also controversial
- Many traditional scholars thought Kang was a fraud
- But his framing mattered: reform as Chinese tradition, not Western imposition
- Liang Qichao was the better communicator—his essays reached thousands

#### Slide 16: The Guangxu Emperor's Gamble
**Content:**
- **1898:** Young Guangxu Emperor (age 27) decides to act
- He had been emperor since age 4; Cixi controlled him as regent
- **June 11, 1898:** Guangxu summons Kang Youwei to audience
- **June 11 – September 21:** The "Hundred Days Reform"
  - 103 days of frantic reform edicts
  - Over 100 decrees issued
- **What they proposed:**
  - Abolish the eight-legged essay examination
  - Establish modern schools and university
  - Create government bureaus for commerce, industry, railroads
  - Reorganize the military
  - Streamline government bureaucracy

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Guangxu Emperor photograph portrait"
- Search: "Guangxu Emperor China photograph" or "光緒帝 portrait"
- Sources: Palace Museum Beijing, historical photographs

**Presenter Notes:**
- Guangxu was intelligent and genuinely wanted reform
- But he had been controlled by Cixi his entire life—she made him emperor
- His decision to act independently was a huge gamble
- The reforms were comprehensive—attacking every conservative interest at once
- Abolishing eight-legged essay threatened everyone who'd invested in classical education
- Streamlining government meant firing bureaucrats
- He was moving too fast for anyone to adjust

#### Slide 17: Why Conservatives Panicked
**Content:**
- **Who felt threatened?**
  - **Examination graduates:** Their qualifications would become worthless
  - **Banner aristocracy:** Military reform might cut their stipends
  - **Manchu elite:** Some reformers had anti-Manchu sentiments
  - **Cixi's allies:** Anything strengthening emperor weakened them
- **The speed was terrifying:** Everything changing at once, no time to adjust
- **Rumor:** Reformers might arrest Cixi herself

**Presenter Notes:**
- Put yourself in a conservative official's shoes
- You spent 20 years mastering the classics, passed exams, got position
- Suddenly: examination system abolished, your expertise worthless
- Of course you oppose reform—your life is being destroyed
- The Manchu angle was explosive: some reformers were ethnic nationalists
- Bannermen feared reform meant abolishing their entire way of life
- And rumors spread that reformers might move against Cixi—true or not, she couldn't risk it

#### Slide 18: Cixi's Coup
**Content:**
- **September 21, 1898:** Cixi acts
  - Guangxu Emperor placed under house arrest
  - Remained prisoner until his death (1908)
  - Six leading reformers executed ("the Six Martyrs")
  - Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao escape abroad
  - All reform edicts cancelled
- **The Hundred Days Reform was over**
- But was Cixi the villain—or a realist?

**Presenter Notes:**
- Cixi moved decisively once she decided to act
- She had military support—the key generals backed her, not Guangxu
- The executions were brutal and public—message sent
- Kang and Liang escaped with foreign help; spent years in exile
- Guangxu spent remaining 10 years essentially imprisoned
- The standard narrative: Cixi killed reform and doomed China
- But consider: the reforms were chaotic, faced massive opposition, might have failed anyway
- Cixi's calculation: better to preserve dynasty than risk collapse through uncontrolled change

#### Slide 19: Evaluating Cixi
**Content:**
- **The case against Cixi:**
  - Blocked reform when China desperately needed it
  - Prioritized her own power over national survival
  - The Boxer disaster (1900) happened on her watch
- **The case for Cixi:**
  - The Hundred Days reforms were chaotic, might have failed anyway
  - She had supported Self-Strengthening for decades
  - She was trying to preserve stability in impossible circumstances
- **Key question:** Was she villain or tragic figure—or both?

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is genuinely debatable—historians disagree
- Cixi is easy to blame, but consider her constraints
- She was a woman in a system that excluded women from power
- She survived and ruled for nearly 50 years—that took extraordinary skill
- But her survival came at China's expense
- After 1898, she did implement some reforms (New Policies, 1901-1908)
- Too little, too late—the dynasty fell three years after her death
- Let students form their own judgment

---

### SECTION 3: THE JAPAN COMPARISON (Slides 20-25)
**[41:00–52:00] 11 minutes**

#### Slide 20: Section Header
**Content:**
- "Why Not China? The Japan Comparison"

**Presenter Notes:**
- Transition: Now the big comparative question
- Both faced Western pressure; both tried to modernize
- Japan succeeded (by one measure); China failed (by that measure)
- Multiple explanations exist—each with different implications

#### Slide 21: What Japan Did Differently
**Content:**
- **The Meiji Restoration (1868):**
  - Young samurai overthrew the Tokugawa shogunate
  - Restored Emperor to power (as symbol)
  - Small group of oligarchs controlled policy
- **Comprehensive transformation:**
  - Abolished feudalism and samurai class (their own class!)
  - Created conscript army (not regional militias)
  - Wrote constitution (1889)
  - Universal education (modern curriculum)
  - Land reform and new tax system

**IMAGE PLACEHOLDER:** "Meiji Emperor Japan portrait"
- Search: "Meiji Emperor Japan photograph" or "明治天皇"
- Sources: Japanese historical archives, museum collections

**Presenter Notes:**
- Emphasize: the Meiji reformers abolished THEMSELVES as a class
- Samurai gave up their swords, their stipends, their privileges
- This is astonishing—equivalent of Chinese bannermen voluntarily disbanding
- Why did Japanese samurai do this? Complex—nationalism, crisis, leadership
- The key: they agreed on direction and could implement unified policy
- No equivalent in China: no unified reform coalition, no willingness to sacrifice privileges

#### Slide 22: Explaining the Difference — Framework 1
**Content:**
- **Political Structure:**
  - **Japan:** Small, unified reform faction controlled central government
  - **China:** Power fragmented between court, Manchu elite, regional governors, conservatives
- **Japan:** Oligarchs could override opposition
- **China:** Every reform faced resistance from multiple power centers
- **Implication:** Institutional structure mattered more than culture

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is the "institutional" explanation
- Japan's smaller size and unified leadership enabled coordinated reform
- China's vast size and fragmented authority made coordination impossible
- Even if Cixi had supported radical reform, could she have implemented it?
- Regional governors would resist central control
- Conservatives would obstruct at every level
- This explanation doesn't blame Chinese culture—blames political structure

#### Slide 23: Explaining the Difference — Framework 2
**Content:**
- **Leadership and Will:**
  - **Japan:** Meiji oligarchs were willing to sacrifice their own privileges
  - **China:** No group was willing to abolish itself
- Manchu could not reform away Manchu privileges
- Banner aristocracy would not vote for its own extinction
- **Implication:** The Manchu conquest created permanent obstacle to reform

**Presenter Notes:**
- This adds ethnic dimension to political explanation
- Japanese samurai could become businessmen, bureaucrats, officers—they had options
- Chinese Manchu elite had ONLY the banner system—nothing else
- Reforming that system meant Manchu extinction as a privileged class
- The conquest structure locked in resistance to change
- This raises counterfactual: What if a Han Chinese dynasty had faced the 19th century?

#### Slide 24: Explaining the Difference — Framework 3
**Content:**
- **Timing and External Pressure:**
  - **Japan:** Modernized before facing serious war
  - **China:** Faced wars (Opium, Taiping, French) while trying to reform
- Japan had 25 years of relative peace (1868-1894) to transform
- China was constantly in crisis—no breathing room
- **Implication:** Both were capable of reform; China just had worse luck

**Presenter Notes:**
- This explanation emphasizes contingency over structure
- Japan's geography helped: island nation, harder to invade
- China's coasts were vulnerable, interior rebellions drained resources
- Japan could focus; China was always distracted by the next crisis
- This is less satisfying as explanation but reminds us: nothing was inevitable
- Different timing might have produced different outcome

#### Slide 25: Avoiding Determinism
**Content:**
- **What we should NOT conclude:**
  - Chinese culture was "backward" or "static"
  - Confucianism was incompatible with modernity
  - China was "destined" to fail
- **What we SHOULD recognize:**
  - Choices mattered—different decisions might have changed outcomes
  - Structure constrained choices—but didn't eliminate them
  - The comparison should prompt questions, not easy answers
- **Modern China's rise suggests:** Late 19th-century failure was not permanent verdict

**Presenter Notes:**
- This is crucial: avoid cultural determinism
- Early 20th-century explanations often blamed "Oriental backwardness"—racist and wrong
- Confucianism didn't prevent modernization—Japan was also Confucian-influenced
- China's post-1978 transformation proves the country was capable of change
- The 19th-century failure was real but historically specific
- Students should leave with questions, not smug answers

---

### ⏸ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (Slide 26)
**[52:00–55:00] 3 minutes**

#### Slide 26: Pause & Process — Evaluating Cixi
**Content:**
- **Quick Reflection (2 minutes):**
- "Cixi is often blamed for China's failure to reform."
- "But she supported Self-Strengthening for decades. What changed in 1898?"
- "Was she protecting Manchu privilege? Her own power? Stability? All three?"
- "Could any ruler in her position have done better?"

**Presenter Notes:**
- **Purpose:** Complicate easy villain narrative
- **What you're doing:**
  1. 2 minutes reflection
  2. Ask for 2-3 quick responses
- **Expected responses:**
  - She was protecting herself
  - She was protecting the Manchu
  - Maybe the reforms were genuinely dangerous
  - Anyone in her position would have done the same
- **Key insight:** Individuals operate within constraints; judging them requires understanding those constraints
- **Transition to wrap-up**

---

### WRAP-UP AND PREVIEW (Slides 27-29)
**[55:00–58:00] 3 minutes**

#### Slide 27: Key Takeaways
**Content:**
- **Self-Strengthening:** Technology without institutional change proved inadequate
- **Hundred Days:** Radical reform threatened too many interests, too fast
- **Japan comparison:** Different political structures, not different cultures, explain different outcomes
- **Cixi:** Neither pure villain nor innocent victim—a skilled survivor in impossible circumstances
- **By 1900:** China humiliated, indebted, seemingly helpless—but the story continues

**Presenter Notes:**
- Synthesize the three main arguments
- Emphasize: the question "why not China?" has no single answer
- Different frameworks highlight different factors
- Cixi thread reaches conclusion: she won every battle but lost the war for dynasty's survival
- After her death (1908), dynasty lasted only 3 more years

#### Slide 28: Connecting to the Boxer Video
**Content:**
- **The Boxer Rebellion (1900)** — which you watched in your video:
  - Popular anti-foreign movement supported (disastrously) by Cixi
  - Eight-nation invasion of Beijing
  - Massive indemnities imposed on China
- **After 1900:** Cixi finally implemented serious reforms (too late)
- **Chapter 24-25 preview:** Revolution and the end of the dynasty (1911)

**Presenter Notes:**
- Reference their video—ask if they have questions
- The Boxer disaster forced even Cixi to accept radical reform
- Her "New Policies" (1901-1908) abolished examinations, reformed military, created schools
- But too late—the dynasty's legitimacy was gone
- Within three years of Cixi's death, the dynasty fell
- The story continues in Chapters 24-25

#### Slide 29: Key Terms Review
**Content:**
- **Self-Strengthening Movement** (1861-1895) — Technology adoption without institutional change
- **"Zhongti Xiyong"** (中體西用) — "Chinese essence, Western use"
- **Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895)** — Defeat that discredited Self-Strengthening
- **Kang Youwei** — Radical reformer who reinterpreted Confucius
- **Liang Qichao** — Journalist and reformer, Kang's student
- **Hundred Days Reform (1898)** — 103 days of radical reform, crushed by Cixi
- **Meiji Restoration (1868)** — Japan's comprehensive modernization

**Presenter Notes:**
- Quick review of essential terms
- Kang and Liang remain important in 20th century (Liang especially influential)
- Meiji comparison is classic exam question material
- Emphasize: "Zhongti Xiyong" captures Self-Strengthening's core assumption and limitation

## PRIMARY SOURCE OPTIONS

**Feng Guifen, "On the Adoption of Western Learning" (1861):**

> "Why are the Western nations small yet strong, while China is large yet weak?... If we let Chinese ethics and Confucian teachings serve as the foundation, and supplement them with the techniques of wealth and power of the various nations, would this not be the best of all solutions?"

**Use:** Shows Self-Strengthening's core formula and its appeal

**Kang Youwei, Memorial to the Guangxu Emperor (1898):**

> "Above, they are to broaden His Majesty's sagelike understanding so that he can sit in one room and know the world. Below, they are to bring together the minds and wills of the empire so that all can share cares and pleasures, forgetting the distinction between public and private.... Sovereign and people will be of one body, and China will be as one family."

**Use:** Shows radical reform vision—constitutional monarchy, national unity

## TEACHING NOTES

**Common Misconceptions to Address:**
1. "Chinese culture prevented modernization" — No; Japan was also Confucian-influenced
2. "Cixi was simply evil" — More complicated; she had constraints and some flexibility
3. "Self-Strengthening was a total failure" — No; it built real capacity, just not enough
4. "Japan's success was inevitable" — No; Japan could have failed too

**Discussion Strategies:**
- Use the Japan comparison carefully—avoid implying Japanese superiority
- Present multiple explanatory frameworks and let students evaluate
- The Cixi question is great for debate

**Connections to Make:**
- Link back to Lectures 1-2: the problems identified there shape reform possibilities
- Forward to revolution (Chapters 24-25): what happens when reform fails
- Modern China: the country eventually DID modernize—19th-century failure wasn't permanent

**Timing Notes:**
- Section 1 (Self-Strengthening) can run long—compress Slide 7 if needed
- Japan comparison (Section 3) is crucial—don't rush
- Cixi evaluation should have time for student reflection

**Sensitive Topics:**
- Japan comparison: be careful not to reinforce stereotypes about Asia
- Cixi's gender: acknowledge that being a woman ruler shaped her constraints
- Avoid determinism: students should see contingency, not inevitability
