### Lecture Theme

The Chinese Civil War of 1946-1949 remains one of history's most dramatic reversals of fortune. The Nationalist government began with every apparent advantage: more troops, modern weapons, control of cities, American support, and international recognition. Within four years, it had collapsed entirely, fleeing to Taiwan as Mao Zedong proclaimed the People's Republic. This lecture examines how a government that seemed unassailable dissolved so quickly—and what the Communist victory meant for China and the world.

---

### Central Story

We'll trace the civil war through multiple lenses: the hyperinflation that destroyed middle-class faith in the Nationalist government, the battlefield disasters that swallowed Chiang's best armies, and the peasant mobilization that provided the Communists with inexhaustible manpower and support. The story of 1949 is ultimately a story of legitimacy—of why millions of Chinese came to see the Communists as the nation's future while the Nationalists lost the "mandate of heaven."

---

### Historiographical Context (approximately 10 minutes)

**Explaining the Outcome:** The Communist victory provoked decades of debate. During the Cold War, American "China hands" were accused of "losing China," and the question of "who lost China" poisoned American politics. Scholars have offered competing explanations: military factors (Communist strategy vs. Nationalist incompetence), economic factors (hyperinflation), political factors (corruption and authoritarian repression), social factors (peasant mobilization), and international factors (American and Soviet roles). Odd Arne Westad's *Decisive Encounters* argues that ideology—both parties' genuine beliefs about China's future—shaped their actions and determined the outcome. We'll examine how all these factors intersected.

## OPENING: The Price of Rice (5-7 minutes)

**[Before Class]**: Display chart showing price inflation in Nationalist China, 1945-1949

Begin with a story that illustrates the economic catastrophe:

In 1937, one Chinese yuan could buy a reasonable meal. By December 1948, the same meal cost 101,000,000,000,000 yuan.

**The Numbers:**
Show inflation chart:
- July 1945: Price index = 100
- December 1945: 228
- December 1946: 580
- December 1947: 10,340
- December 1948: 287,700,000

**[Click slide: Photograph of people pushing wheelbarrows of money]**

**Opening Question:** "What happens to a government when the money it prints becomes worthless? Who suffers most? Who might benefit?"

[Allow brief student responses]

**The Human Cost:**
The inflation destroyed the Chinese middle class—the teachers, civil servants, professionals, and small businesspeople who should have been the Nationalist government's base of support. Life savings became worthless overnight. Salaries couldn't keep up with prices. People resorted to barter.

A university professor recalled: "My monthly salary was enough to buy three eggs. We survived by selling furniture, then books, then clothing."

**Transition:** The hyperinflation was a symptom of deeper problems—a government that had lost its ability to govern, an army that had lost its will to fight, and a population that had lost faith in its rulers. Today we examine the final collapse of Nationalist China and the Communist victory that remade the world.

## CORE CONTENT

### Segment 1: The Failed Peace (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 7 minutes into class]**

**The Situation in August 1945:**
Japan's sudden surrender created a race to fill the vacuum:
- Japanese forces still occupied major cities and communication lines
- Nationalist forces were concentrated in southwest China
- Communist forces were positioned throughout north China
- Soviet forces had invaded Manchuria

**The American Role:**
The United States, hoping to prevent civil war and create a stable, friendly China, airlifted Nationalist troops to key cities and sent Marines to hold ports and railways until Nationalist forces arrived. American planes carried 100,000 Nationalist troops to Shanghai, Nanjing, and Beijing.

But America couldn't—or wouldn't—fight the Communists directly.

**The Marshall Mission:**
In December 1945, President Truman sent General George Marshall, the architect of Allied victory in World War II, to mediate between Nationalists and Communists.

Marshall's mission was doomed from the start:
- Neither side genuinely wanted compromise
- Both believed they could win militarily
- Deep distrust from decades of conflict made cooperation impossible
- American military aid to the Nationalists undercut American neutrality

After a year of frustrating negotiations, Marshall returned to Washington. Civil war began in earnest.

**[Click slide: Marshall meeting with Chiang and Communist representatives]**

**Why Mediation Failed:**
Both parties were ideologically committed to visions of China's future that could not be reconciled:
- The Nationalists would not share real power or accept land reform
- The Communists would not disarm or integrate their forces into a Nationalist-controlled government

As Mao put it: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Whoever had the guns would decide China's future.

**Chiang's Confidence:**
In 1946, Chiang appeared to have every advantage:
- 4.3 million troops versus about 1.2 million Communist forces
- Modern American weapons including tanks, artillery, and aircraft
- Control of all major cities
- International recognition and American support
- Apparent military momentum

Chiang predicted victory within six months.

### Segment 2: The Military Collapse (12 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 17 minutes into class]**

**Initial Nationalist Successes:**
In 1946 and early 1947, Nationalist forces won battlefield victories:
- Captured the Communist capital of Yan'an (March 1947)
- Seized key cities in Manchuria
- Pushed Communist forces into rural areas

Headlines proclaimed Nationalist triumph.

**The Manchurian Trap:**
But Chiang made a fateful strategic error: he insisted on holding Manchuria despite his generals' warnings. Manchuria's industrial base—built by Japan—seemed too valuable to abandon.

**[Click slide: Map showing Manchurian campaign]**

Communist forces, under brilliant commander Lin Biao, cut the rail lines connecting Nationalist garrisons to the coast. Isolated in hostile territory, surrounded by Communist base areas, Nationalist forces were picked off one by one.

**The Liaoshen Campaign (September-November 1948):**
The decisive battle came in late 1948. Lin Biao surrounded and destroyed the cream of Nationalist armies in Manchuria:
- 470,000 Nationalist troops killed, wounded, or captured
- Massive quantities of American equipment seized
- The best-trained Nationalist divisions eliminated

**Why Nationalists Lost Battles They Should Have Won:**

Multiple factors explain the military disaster:

1. **Strategy:** Chiang insisted on holding fixed positions and cities rather than destroying enemy forces—the opposite of sound military doctrine

2. **Leadership:** Chiang micromanaged battles, overruling field commanders by radio from thousands of miles away

3. **Morale:** Nationalist soldiers, many of them unwilling conscripts, had little reason to fight; desertion was epidemic

4. **Logistics:** Corruption siphoned off supplies; troops were often unpaid and hungry

5. **Intelligence:** Communist sympathizers had infiltrated Nationalist headquarters; battle plans were often known in advance

**The Huaihai Campaign (November 1948-January 1949):**
Even as Manchuria fell, the decisive battle of the war began in central China. At Huaihai, near the railway junction of Xuzhou, Communist forces surrounded and destroyed another 550,000 Nationalist troops.

**[Click slide: Map showing Huaihai campaign]**

What made Huaihai remarkable was the role of peasant support. While the Nationalists struggled to supply their troops, Communist forces were supported by an estimated 5.4 million peasant laborers who:
- Pushed wheelbarrows of ammunition to the front
- Carried wounded soldiers to hospitals
- Brought food and supplies
- Built roads and bridges

One Communist general later said: "The Huaihai Campaign was won by peasants pushing wheelbarrows."

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #1 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 29 minutes into class]**

**Discussion Prompt:** "Chiang Kaishek had more troops, better weapons, and American support. Yet he lost decisively. Based on what we've discussed, what do you think was the single most important factor in his defeat?"

[Allow brief student discussion]

**Key insight:** Material advantages mean little without the will to fight and popular support. The Nationalists had guns but not legitimacy.

---

### Segment 3: The Collapse of Nationalist Legitimacy (10 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 32 minutes into class]**

**Transition:** The military disasters didn't happen in isolation. They reflected a broader collapse of Nationalist legitimacy across Chinese society.

**Economic Catastrophe:**
The hyperinflation we discussed in the opening wasn't just an economic problem—it was a political indictment. A government that couldn't maintain stable currency was a government that couldn't govern.

In August 1948, the Nationalists tried currency reform, issuing a new "gold yuan." They promised it would hold its value. Within months, it too was worthless. The reform was seen as outright theft by a desperate regime.

**Urban Alienation:**
The middle classes who should have supported the Nationalists turned against them:
- Students protested government repression and incompetence
- Workers struck against wages that couldn't keep up with prices
- Intellectuals faced censorship and political persecution
- Businesspeople saw their profits consumed by corruption and inflation

**[Click slide: Student protesters in Shanghai, 1948]**

**The Secret Police:**
Chiang's response to dissent was repression. His secret police arrested, tortured, and killed suspected dissidents. Universities were raided. Newspapers were shut down. The "White Terror" of 1947-1949 echoed the massacres of 1927.

But repression couldn't restore legitimacy—it only deepened alienation.

**Rural Indifference:**
Peasants, who might have defended the government against Communist revolution, had no reason to do so. The Nationalists had never implemented land reform. Landlords still extracted crushing rents. Nothing the government offered matched what the Communists promised.

When Communist armies approached, peasants often welcomed them or simply stood aside.

**The American Dilemma:**
By 1948, American officials knew the Nationalists were losing. But what could they do?
- Direct military intervention was politically impossible after World War II
- More aid would just be lost to corruption and battlefield defeat
- The Communists were too strong to be defeated by anything short of massive American ground forces

The Truman administration chose to let events take their course.

**The Question of Legitimacy:**
The traditional Chinese concept of the "Mandate of Heaven" held that rulers governed by divine sanction—and that heaven could withdraw its mandate from unworthy rulers, shown through natural disasters, rebellions, and military defeats.

By 1949, many Chinese—including many Nationalist supporters—felt that heaven had clearly withdrawn its mandate from Chiang Kaishek.

### Segment 4: The People's Republic Is Born (8 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 42 minutes into class]**

**The Final Campaigns:**
After Huaihai, Nationalist resistance collapsed rapidly:
- January 1949: Communist forces entered Beijing peacefully
- April 1949: The capital Nanjing fell
- May 1949: Shanghai fell
- Communist armies swept south, meeting little organized resistance

**The Crossing of the Yangzi:**
On April 21, 1949, Communist forces crossed the Yangzi River—the traditional dividing line between north and south China. The Nationalists, who had hoped to hold south China as a rump state, were finished.

**The Flight to Taiwan:**
Chiang Kaishek and what remained of the Nationalist government retreated to Taiwan, which had been returned to China after Japanese surrender. About 2 million soldiers, officials, and refugees followed.

Chiang took the government's gold reserves and its art treasures. He maintained that his government was the legitimate government of all China—a claim the United States would support for the next twenty-two years.

**October 1, 1949:**
On October 1, 1949, Mao Zedong stood at Tiananmen—the Gate of Heavenly Peace—in Beijing and proclaimed the People's Republic of China.

*"The Chinese people have stood up!"*

**[Click slide: Mao proclaiming the People's Republic, October 1, 1949]**

**What Had Changed:**
The Communist victory marked a profound transformation:
- China's two-thousand-year-old imperial tradition was definitively ended
- A new state modeled on Soviet communism would restructure society from top to bottom
- Land reform would eliminate the landlord class entirely
- Women would gain legal equality
- China would industrialize through central planning
- A new ideology—Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought—would guide all aspects of life

**World Historical Significance:**
The Communist victory in China was among the most consequential events of the twentieth century:
- It brought one-quarter of humanity under communist rule
- It transformed the Cold War, making Asia a central battleground
- It inspired revolutionary movements throughout the developing world
- It created the conditions for the Korean War and decades of Sino-American confrontation

### ★ PAUSE & PROCESS #2 (3 minutes)

**[Timeline note: approximately 50 minutes into class]**

**Final Reflection:** "In 1949, many Chinese—even those who weren't communists—welcomed the revolution as a new beginning after decades of war, chaos, and humiliation. What do you think they hoped for? What do you think they feared?"

[Students reflect briefly]

## CLOSING: The End and the Beginning (2 minutes)

**[Timeline note: Final 2 minutes]**

**Synthesis:**
The Communist victory of 1949 was the product of many factors:
- Nationalist military incompetence and strategic blunders
- Economic catastrophe that destroyed middle-class faith in the government
- Political repression that alienated potential supporters
- Communist skill at peasant mobilization and guerrilla warfare
- Land reform that gave peasants a stake in Communist victory
- The discipline and dedication of Communist cadres
- The exhaustion of a population that had endured decades of war

But above all, it was a verdict on the question of legitimacy. The Nationalists had failed to build a government that commanded the loyalty of the Chinese people. The Communists, for all their faults, offered a vision of China's future that millions found compelling.

**Looking Forward:**
What the Communists would do with their victory—how they would transform Chinese society, at what cost, with what consequences—is a story that continues to unfold. We'll examine that story in our next chapter.

**Closing Thought:**
In 1949, China was desperately poor, war-ravaged, technologically backward. But for the first time in a century, it was unified under a strong central government. No foreign power controlled its ports. No unequal treaties bound its sovereignty.

Mao's declaration that "the Chinese people have stood up" resonated precisely because so many Chinese had felt that their nation had been prostrate—under foreign domination, internal division, and humiliation.

What kind of nation they would build—whether the revolution would fulfill its promises or betray them—remained to be seen.

## SERIES CONCLUSION

With this lecture, we complete our examination of China from the fall of the Qing through the Communist victory. The three chapters we've covered (24, 25, and the forthcoming 27) trace an arc of destruction and reconstruction:

- **Chapter 24:** The collapse of imperial China and the failed attempt to build a republic
- **Chapter 25:** The decades of war—civil war, Japanese invasion, civil war again—that culminated in Communist victory
- **Chapter 27:** What the Communists did with power (covered in future lectures)

The China that emerged in 1949 was radically different from the China of 1900. But many questions remained: Could the Communists succeed where the Nationalists had failed? Could they industrialize a vast, impoverished country? Could they create the new society they promised?

Those questions would be answered—often painfully—in the decades to come.
